## What Is Hazard Identification

Hazard identification is the process of recognizing and documenting conditions, activities, or situations that could potentially cause incidents or service disruptions. It's a proactive component of incident management that aims to address risks before they cause problems.

## Why Is Hazard Identification Important

Proactive hazard identification helps prevent incidents before they occur. By systematically identifying potential failure points, organizations can implement preventive measures, reducing both the frequency and severity of incidents their teams must manage.

## Example Of Hazard Identification

An incident management team reviews system logs and notices increasing memory usage in a critical application server. By identifying this trend as a potential hazard, they can address the memory leak before it causes a system crash and service outage.

## How To Identify Hazard

- Establish regular system and infrastructure reviews to spot potential issues
- Implement monitoring tools that detect abnormal patterns or threshold violations
- Create channels for frontline staff to report potential hazards they observe
- Review past incidents to identify recurring patterns or root causes
- Conduct scenario planning to identify vulnerabilities in critical systems
