## What Is Judgment Call

A judgment call is a decision made using experience, intuition, and critical thinking in situations not clearly defined by rules. It often happens in complex or unexpected circumstances where standard procedures don't fully apply.

## Why Is Judgment Call Important

Judgment calls are vital for handling unique or edge cases effectively. They empower responders to assess risk and make timely decisions. This is crucial when procedures are ambiguous or incomplete.

## Example Of Judgment Call

A security team finds unusual network traffic. Automated tools don't flag it as malicious. However, an experienced analyst uses their judgment. They recognize subtle patterns indicating a potential threat and escalate the issue for investigation.
