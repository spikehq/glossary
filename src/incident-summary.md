## What Is Incident Summary

An incident summary is a brief overview of an incident, including what happened, when it occurred, and its impact. It helps teams understand the situation quickly and decide on next steps.

## Why Is Incident Summary Important

A clear incident summary saves time during investigations and debriefs. It gives everyone a shared understanding of the incident, which improves response and learning.

## Example of Incident Summary

A summary might state: "On May 10th, the database server crashed at 2:00 AM, affecting user logins for 30 minutes. The root cause was a failed update."

## Best Practices

- Keep summaries concise and factual
- Include key details: time, impact, and cause
- Write summaries right after the incident for accuracy
