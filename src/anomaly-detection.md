## What Is Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection in incident management is the automated process of identifying unusual patterns or behaviors that deviate from expected system performance. It uses statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to spot potential incidents before they impact users or business operations.

## Why Is Anomaly Detection Important

Anomaly detection helps teams identify and address issues before they escalate into major incidents. It reduces false alerts by focusing on genuine deviations from normal patterns, enables proactive response to emerging problems, and minimizes service disruptions through early detection.

## Example Of Anomaly Detection

A cloud service provider's monitoring system detects an unusual spike in memory usage on a database server at 2 AM, outside normal peak hours. The system automatically creates an incident ticket, allowing the on-call engineer to investigate and fix a memory leak before it causes a service outage.

## How To Implement Anomaly Detection

- Select key metrics to monitor (CPU, memory, network traffic, error rates)
- Establish baseline performance patterns for each metric
- Choose appropriate detection algorithms based on your data patterns
- Set up alerting thresholds and notification channels
- Regularly review and refine your detection rules

## Best Practices

- Start with a few critical metrics rather than trying to monitor everything
- Combine anomaly detection with human verification for critical systems
- Continuously update baseline models as your systems evolve
