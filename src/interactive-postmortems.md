## What Are Interactive Postmortems

Interactive Postmortems are collaborative incident review sessions where team members actively participate in analyzing what happened during an incident, why it occurred, and how to prevent similar issues. Unlike traditional written reports, these sessions use digital tools for real-time collaboration, timeline creation, and action item tracking.

## Why Are Interactive Postmortems Important

Interactive Postmortems improve team engagement and knowledge sharing during incident reviews. They capture diverse perspectives, create shared understanding of complex incidents, and increase ownership of follow-up actions. This collaborative approach leads to more thorough analysis and effective prevention strategies.

## Example Of Interactive Postmortems

After a major service outage, a team uses a digital whiteboard where members add their observations to a shared timeline. They use voting features to identify the most significant contributing factors, collaboratively diagram the incident flow, and assign action items in real time.

## How To Create Interactive Postmortems

- Choose collaborative tools that support real-time editing and visualization
- Create a structured template with timeline, contributing factors, and action items
- Invite all stakeholders who were involved in the incident
- Designate a facilitator to guide the discussion
- Document decisions and action items during the session

## Best Practices

- Maintain a blameless culture by focusing on systems and processes, not individuals
- Use visual aids like timelines and diagrams to clarify complex incident sequences
- Schedule the postmortem soon after resolution while details are still fresh
