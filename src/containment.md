## What Is Containment

Containment is the process of limiting the scope and impact of an active incident to prevent it from spreading or causing additional damage. It involves isolating affected systems, implementing temporary workarounds, and taking immediate actions to stabilize the situation.

## Why Is Containment Important

Containment stops incidents from escalating into larger problems. By quickly limiting the scope of an incident, teams can reduce customer impact, prevent cascading failures across systems, and create space to develop proper resolution strategies. Effective containment often determines how severe an incident ultimately becomes.

## Example of Containment

When a company detects unusual traffic overwhelming their API servers, they immediately implement rate limiting, temporarily disable non-essential features, and route traffic through additional servers. These containment measures keep core services running while the team investigates the root cause.

## How to Implement Containment

- Develop containment strategies for common incident types
- Create decision trees for containment actions based on incident characteristics
- Implement technical safeguards that can be quickly activated
- Train teams on containment procedures for their systems
- Document containment actions for post-incident review

## Best Practices

- Prioritize containing customer-facing impacts first
- Balance containment actions against their potential side effects
- Communicate containment measures to all response team members
