## What Is First Responder

A first responder in incident management is the person or team who reacts first to an alert or incident. They assess the situation, start troubleshooting, and may escalate the issue if needed.

## Why Is First Responder Important

First responders help reduce downtime by acting quickly when incidents occur. Their fast action can limit the impact on users and business operations.

## Example Of First Responder

A site reliability engineer receives a high-priority alert at 2 AM. She investigates the issue, restarts a failed service, and updates the incident log before passing it to the next team.
