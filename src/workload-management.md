## What Is Workload Management

Workload Management in incident response involves distributing tasks effectively among team members. It aims to prevent individuals from becoming overloaded, especially during stressful incidents, and optimizes team performance.

## Why Is Workload Management Important

Effective workload management prevents responder burnout and maintains the quality of incident response. It ensures tasks are handled efficiently by the right people and supports a sustainable on-call environment.

## Example Of Workload Management

During a complex incident, the Incident Commander assigns investigation tasks to specific responders based on their expertise and current assignments. They also monitor the team's status, reassigning tasks if someone becomes overwhelmed or needs a break.

## How To Implement Workload Management

- Use tools to visualize who is working on what during an incident
- Maintain fair and transparent on-call schedules
- Encourage team members to communicate their capacity limits
- Consider task complexity, not just quantity, when assigning work
- Review workload distribution during post-incident reviews

## Best Practices

- Assign tasks based on skills and current availability
- Rotate demanding roles (like Incident Commander) during long incidents
- Foster a culture where it's okay to ask for help or decline tasks when overloaded

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Consistently assigning critical tasks to the same few experts
- Ignoring signs of burnout in team members
- Lack of visibility into who is working on what

## KPIs For Workload Management

- Distribution of incident tasks across the team over time
- Frequency and duration of on-call shifts per person
- Team feedback on workload balance and burnout levels
