## What Is Automated Incident Routing

Automated Incident Routing is the process of automatically assigning incidents to the appropriate teams or individuals based on predefined rules and criteria. It directs issues to those best equipped to resolve them without manual intervention.

## Why Is Automated Incident Routing Important

Automated Incident Routing eliminates the delay of manual triage and assignment. It reduces human error in routing decisions, gets incidents to the right experts faster, and helps balance workload across teams for more efficient incident management.

## Example of Automated Incident Routing

A database error automatically routes to the database team, while a network connectivity issue routes to the network operations team. Each incident includes severity level and SLA information to help teams prioritize their work.
