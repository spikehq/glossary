## What Is Problem Management

Problem management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and resolving the underlying causes of recurring incidents. Unlike incident management which focuses on restoring service quickly, problem management aims to prevent incidents by addressing root causes and implementing permanent solutions.

## Why Is Problem Management Important

Problem management reduces incident frequency and impact over time. It shifts organizations from reactive firefighting to proactive prevention, lowers operational costs, improves service reliability, and frees up technical resources to work on improvements rather than repetitive fixes.

## Example Of Problem Management

After noticing three similar database timeout incidents in one month, a problem management team investigates and discovers an inefficient query pattern. They implement query optimization, add database indexes, and update development guidelines, preventing future occurrences of these incidents.

## How To Implement Problem Management

- Identify trends and patterns in incident data
- Prioritize problems based on business impact
- Conduct root cause analysis on high-impact problems
- Develop and implement permanent solutions
- Track effectiveness through reduced incident metrics

## Best Practices

- Separate problem management from incident response roles
- Maintain a known error database to document workarounds
- Focus on systemic issues rather than isolated incidents
