## What Is Categorization In Incident Management

Categorization in incident management is the process of classifying incidents based on their type, impact, urgency, or other relevant attributes. This systematic approach helps route incidents to appropriate teams and prioritize response efforts effectively.

## Why Is Categorization Important In Incident Management

Proper categorization ensures incidents receive the right level of attention and expertise. It streamlines triage, enables accurate reporting, and helps identify recurring issues. Without effective categorization, critical incidents might be overlooked while minor issues consume valuable resources.

## Example Of Categorization In Incident Management

An e-commerce company categorizes incidents as P1 (complete service outage), P2 (major functionality affected), P3 (minor functionality affected), or P4 (cosmetic issues). When the payment processing system fails, it's immediately categorized as P1, triggering an all-hands response with executive notification.
