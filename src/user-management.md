## What Is User Management

User management in incident management is the process of creating, controlling, and deleting user accounts within incident response systems. It includes defining roles, permissions, and access levels to balance operational needs with security requirements.

## Why Is User Management Important

Proper user management prevents unauthorized access to sensitive incident data while giving responders the right level of access to perform their duties. It creates accountability through audit trails and helps organizations meet compliance requirements for data protection.

## Example Of User Management

An IT organization configures their incident management platform with different access levels. Tier 1 support can view and update incidents, while only senior engineers can close major incidents. Executive stakeholders receive read-only access to dashboards showing incident status without sensitive details.

## How To Implement User Management

- Inventory all roles that need access to your incident management system
- Define permission levels based on job responsibilities and security requirements
- Create a standardized onboarding and offboarding process for users
- Implement regular access reviews to verify permissions remain appropriate

## Best Practices

- Apply the principle of least privilege, giving users only the access they need
- Automate user provisioning and deprovisioning when possible
- Maintain detailed audit logs of all user activity within incident management systems
