## What Is Alert Enrichment

Alert Enrichment is the process of automatically adding relevant context and information to alerts before they reach responders. It pulls in data from various sources to provide a more complete picture of the issue and its potential impact.

## Why Is Alert Enrichment Important

Alert Enrichment gives responders the context they need to understand and address issues quickly. It reduces time spent gathering basic information, helps with accurate prioritization, and provides insights that might not be obvious from the alert alone.

## Example Of Alert Enrichment

A basic "disk space critical" alert gets enriched with information about which services run on that server, recent changes that might have caused the issue, contact details for the application owner, and links to relevant runbooks.
