## What Are Historical Incident Reports

Historical Incident Reports are comprehensive records of past incidents that document what happened, how teams responded, resolution steps taken, and lessons learned. These reports preserve organizational knowledge about previous incidents and their resolutions.

## Why Are Historical Incident Reports Important

Historical Incident Reports provide valuable reference material for troubleshooting similar issues. They help new team members understand past challenges, prevent knowledge loss when employees leave, and reveal patterns that might indicate underlying problems requiring permanent fixes.

## Example Of Historical Incident Reports

A database team faces an unusual performance degradation issue. By searching historical incident reports, they discover a similar incident from eight months ago with detailed notes on the root cause and resolution steps, saving hours of investigation time.

## How To Make Historical Incident Reports

- Create a standardized template for incident documentation
- Maintain a searchable repository of all incident reports
- Require key details like timeline, impact, resolution steps, and follow-up actions
- Tag reports with relevant categories for easier searching
- Schedule regular reviews of historical incidents to identify patterns

## Best Practices

- Write reports immediately after resolution while details are fresh
- Focus on facts rather than blame or speculation
- Include links to relevant monitoring data, chat logs, and troubleshooting steps taken
