## What Is Resolve

Resolve in incident management refers to the process of fixing an issue and returning affected systems to normal operation. It involves identifying the root cause, implementing a solution, and verifying that the incident has been properly addressed.

## Why Is Resolving Incidents Important

Resolving incidents quickly minimizes downtime, reduces business impact, and maintains user trust. Effective resolution processes help teams learn from incidents, prevent future occurrences, and improve overall system reliability.

## Example of Resolving an Incident

A payment processing system experiences an outage. The incident response team identifies a database connection issue, applies the fix, tests the system, and confirms normal operation. They then document the resolution steps for future reference.

## How to Resolve an Incident

- Confirm the root cause before applying fixes
- Apply the solution methodically and document each step
- Test thoroughly to verify the issue is fixed
- Communicate resolution status to all stakeholders
- Update knowledge bases with resolution details

## Best Practices

- Prioritize permanent fixes over temporary workarounds when possible
- Document resolution steps clearly for future reference
- Conduct a brief review after resolution to identify process improvements
