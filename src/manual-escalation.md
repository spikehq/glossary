## What Is Manual Escalation

Manual escalation is when an on-call responder decides to pass an incident to another team member or a higher-level expert. This is done when the issue is beyond their expertise or authority.

## Why Is Manual Escalation Important

Manual escalation helps incidents get resolved by the right people. It avoids delays that happen when someone tries to fix an issue they can't handle.

## How to Implement Manual Escalation

- Define clear escalation paths and contacts
- Train responders on when and how to escalate
- Document escalation steps in incident response plans
- Use tools that make it easy to hand off incidents
