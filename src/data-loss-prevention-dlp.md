## What Is Data Loss Prevention (DLP)

Data Loss Prevention is a strategy and set of tools designed to detect and prevent unauthorized transmission, access, or use of sensitive information. DLP systems monitor, detect, and block sensitive data while in use, in motion, or at rest to prevent data breaches and leaks.

## Why Is Data Loss Prevention Important

DLP helps organizations protect sensitive data from both internal and external threats. It plays a critical role in incident prevention by identifying risky behaviors before they lead to breaches, maintaining compliance with regulations, and safeguarding intellectual property.

## Example Of Data Loss Prevention

A DLP system detects an employee attempting to email a file containing customer credit card numbers to a personal email address. The system automatically blocks the transmission and alerts the security team, who investigate whether this was a malicious act or an innocent mistake.

## How To Implement Data Loss Prevention

- Identify and classify sensitive data across your organization
- Define policies for how different types of data should be handled
- Deploy DLP tools that monitor endpoints, networks, and cloud services
- Integrate DLP alerts with your incident management system
- Train employees on data handling policies and procedures

## Best Practices

- Start with your most sensitive data and expand protection gradually
- Balance security with usability to avoid disrupting legitimate work
- Regularly review and update DLP policies as business needs change
