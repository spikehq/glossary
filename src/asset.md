## What Is Asset In Incident Management

In incident management, an asset is any component of an organization's IT infrastructure that needs to be monitored, maintained, and protected. Assets include hardware, software, data, services, and systems that support business operations.

## Why Is Asset Important In Incident Management

Understanding your assets is fundamental to effective incident management. You can't protect what you don't know exists. Clear asset visibility helps teams identify affected components during incidents, understand dependencies, and prioritize response efforts based on business impact.

## Example Of Asset In Incident Management

A payment processing API would be considered a critical asset for an e-commerce company. If this API experiences an outage, the incident response team would prioritize its restoration because of its direct impact on revenue.
