## Who Is Backup Responder

A Backup Responder is a designated individual who steps in when the primary on-call responder is unavailable during an incident. They maintain the same level of authority and responsibility to investigate and resolve incidents, ensuring continuous coverage for critical systems.

## Why Is Backup Responder Important

Backup Responders prevent gaps in incident response coverage that could lead to extended outages. They reduce the risk of missed alerts, provide necessary redundancy for 24/7 operations, and help prevent burnout among primary responders by distributing on-call responsibilities.

## Example Of Backup Responder

During a critical database outage at 2 AM, the primary on-call engineer doesn't respond within the 5-minute SLA. The system automatically notifies the backup responder, who acknowledges the alert and begins troubleshooting immediately, minimizing downtime.
