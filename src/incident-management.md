## What Is Incident Management

Incident management is the process of responding to unplanned events or service disruptions to restore normal operations as quickly as possible. It encompasses the entire workflow from detection through resolution, including communication, coordination, and continuous improvement.

## Why Is Incident Management Important

Effective incident management minimizes downtime, reduces business impact, and maintains service quality. It provides structure during stressful situations, improves team coordination, and builds organizational resilience through systematic learning from past incidents.

## Example Of Incident Management

When a cloud service provider experiences a network outage, their incident management process activates. A response team assembles, communicates with affected customers, implements workarounds, resolves the underlying issue, and documents lessons learned to prevent similar incidents.
