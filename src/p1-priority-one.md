## What Is P1 (Priority One)

P1 is the second-highest incident priority level, representing serious incidents that cause significant service degradation or affect a large portion of users. These incidents require urgent attention but may not demand the full-scale response of a P0.

## Why Is P1 Important

P1 incidents significantly impact business operations and user experience. They require prompt resolution to prevent escalation to P0 status and to maintain service reliability and customer satisfaction.

## Example Of P1

A payment processing system experiencing intermittent failures during checkout would be a P1 incident. It doesn't completely prevent all transactions but creates a poor experience for many customers and impacts revenue.
