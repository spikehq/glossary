## What Is Audit Trail

An audit trail in incident management is a secure, comprehensive record that documents the sequence of activities from incident detection through resolution, creating an unalterable history of all actions and decisions.

## Why Is Audit Trail Important

Audit trails provide legal protection by documenting compliance with procedures and regulations. They support incident investigations, help identify process improvements, and maintain accountability for all actions taken during incident response.

## Example Of Audit Trail

A healthcare company experiences a data breach. Their audit trail shows exactly which systems were accessed, what actions responders took, and how patient data was protected. This documentation proves to regulators that the company followed proper incident response protocols.

## How To Create Audit Trail

- Use incident management software with built-in audit trail capabilities
- Document all communications related to incidents
- Record timestamps for each action and decision
- Preserve evidence of incident causes and resolutions
- Implement security measures to prevent audit trail modification

## Best Practices

- Create audit trails that are detailed enough for third-party review
- Establish retention policies that comply with industry regulations
- Regularly test your audit trail system to verify it captures all required information
