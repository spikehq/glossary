## What Is Automated Severity Assignment

Automated Severity Assignment is a process that automatically categorizes incidents by their impact and urgency using predefined criteria. It applies consistent severity levels to incidents without requiring human judgment for initial classification.

## Why Is Automated Severity Assignment Important

Automated Severity Assignment creates consistency in how incidents are prioritized. It helps teams focus on the most critical issues first, removes subjective bias from initial severity ratings, and speeds up the triage process by eliminating manual assessment.

## Example of Automated Severity Assignment

A system outage affecting all users automatically receives a "Critical" severity, while a minor UI bug affecting a small percentage of users receives a "Low" severity. These assignments determine response times and escalation paths.
