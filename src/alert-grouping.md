## What Is Alert Grouping

Alert grouping is the process of combining related alerts into a single notification or case. This helps responders focus on the root issue without getting overwhelmed by multiple, similar alerts.

## Why Is Alert Grouping Important

Alert grouping cuts down noise and alert fatigue, making it easier for teams to spot and respond to real incidents. It speeds up response times and helps teams avoid missing critical issues hidden in a flood of alerts.

## Example of Alert Grouping

If a server goes down, several monitors might trigger alerts for CPU, memory, and network. Alert grouping combines these into one incident, so the responder gets a single notification instead of many.

## How To Implement Alert Grouping With Spike
