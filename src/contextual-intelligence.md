## What Is Contextual Intelligence

Contextual Intelligence in incident management is the ability to automatically gather and present relevant information about an incident based on its specific characteristics. It provides responders with the right context to understand and resolve issues quickly without manual research.

## Why Is Contextual Intelligence Important

Contextual intelligence reduces the time spent gathering information during critical incidents. It helps teams understand the impact, potential causes, and resolution paths faster. This leads to quicker resolutions and less cognitive load on responders during stressful situations.

## Example Of Contextual Intelligence

When a payment processing service fails, the incident management system automatically shows recent code deployments, similar past incidents, current traffic patterns, and which customers are affected. This gives the on-call engineer immediate context without having to search multiple systems.

## How To Implement Contextual Intelligence

- Integrate your incident management platform with monitoring, deployment, and documentation systems
- Create rules to determine what information is relevant for different incident types
- Build a knowledge base of past incidents with resolution steps
- Implement automatic tagging and categorization of incidents
- Design intuitive interfaces that present context without overwhelming responders

## Best Practices

- Prioritize information based on incident severity and type
- Include links to deeper information rather than showing everything at once
- Regularly review and refine what context is most helpful for different scenarios
