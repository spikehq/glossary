## What Is Alert Escalation

Alert escalation is the process of moving an unresolved incident to higher-level responders. This happens when initial responders didn’t acknowledge or couldn’t fix the incident within a set time.

## Why Is Alert Escalation Important

Alert escalation helps incidents get the right attention and resources quickly. It reduces downtime and prevents small issues from becoming major outages.

## Example Of Alert Escalation

A critical server alert is not acknowledged in 10 minutes. The system automatically alerts a senior engineer.
