## What Are Health Monitoring Dashboards

Health Monitoring Dashboards are visual interfaces that display real-time status information about critical systems, services, and infrastructure components. They provide at-a-glance views of system health using color-coded indicators, graphs, and metrics to highlight performance issues.

## Why Are Health Monitoring Dashboards Important

Health Monitoring Dashboards enable teams to quickly spot developing problems before they become major incidents. They create a shared understanding of system status across teams, help prioritize response efforts, and provide historical context during incident investigations.

## Example Of Health Monitoring Dashboards

A DevOps team's dashboard shows green status for most services but displays a yellow warning for database response time that's gradually increasing. This early warning allows them to investigate and address the issue before it impacts users.

## How To Build Health Monitoring Dashboards

- Identify key metrics and health indicators for each critical system
- Set appropriate thresholds for warning and critical states
- Design layouts that highlight the most important information
- Include trend data to show how metrics change over time
- Integrate with alerting systems for consistent incident detection

## Best Practices

- Design for glanceability with clear visual hierarchy and color coding
- Include contextual information like deployment times and maintenance windows
- Customize views for different teams and roles based on their responsibilities
