## What Is Audit Log

An audit log in incident management is a chronological record of all actions taken during an incident, including who performed each action, what was done, and when it occurred.

## Why Is Audit Log Important

Audit logs provide a complete history of incident handling activities. They create accountability, support post-incident reviews, help with compliance requirements, and serve as valuable references for similar future incidents.

## Example Of Audit Log

During a service outage, the incident management system automatically records that Engineer A acknowledged the alert at 2:15 AM, ran diagnostic script B at 2:18 AM, restarted service C at 2:25 AM, and closed the incident at 2:40 AM.

## How To Create Audit Log

- Configure your incident management system to capture all relevant actions
- Include timestamps, user identifications, and detailed action descriptions
- Store logs securely with appropriate retention policies
- Implement access controls for sensitive log information
- Create regular backups of audit log data

## Best Practices

- Make audit logs immutable to prevent tampering
- Include context with each logged action to understand why decisions were made
- Establish a consistent format for logs across different systems
