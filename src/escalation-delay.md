## What Is Escalation Delay

Escalation delay is the time taken between an incident being detected and the moment it is escalated to the next level of response. It measures how quickly issues move up the chain when initial responders cannot resolve them.

## Why Is Escalation Delay Important

Escalation delays give enough time for the responder to acknowledge and work on the incident before calling in the next person.

## Example Of Escalation Delay

A critical database alert is not acknowledged within 10 minutes. The system escalates the alert to a senior engineer, who responds immediately.

## How To Implement Escalation Delay With Spike

- Go to the Escalations section in Spike and click on new escalation
- Add team members and set the wait time before Spike escalates to the next level
- Save your policy. Spike will now alert the next person if the incident isn’t acknowledged in time
