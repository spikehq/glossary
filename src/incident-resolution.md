## What Is Incident Resolution

Incident resolution is the process of restoring normal service operation after an incident has occurred. It involves identifying the root cause, implementing a solution, verifying that service has been restored, and documenting the resolution steps taken.

## Why Is Incident Resolution Important

Effective incident resolution minimizes downtime and reduces the impact on users and business operations. It helps maintain service reliability and customer trust. The speed and quality of incident resolution directly affects an organization's operational efficiency and reputation.

## Example Of Incident Resolution

A payment processing system fails. The incident resolution involves identifying a memory leak in the application, deploying a hotfix to address the issue, verifying that transactions are processing correctly, and documenting the fix for future reference.
