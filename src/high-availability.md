## What Is High Availability

High Availability is a system design approach that ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a higher than normal period. In incident management, high availability systems are designed to operate continuously without failure for a designated period of time through redundancy, failover capabilities, and elimination of single points of failure.

## Why Is High Availability Important

High availability directly impacts business continuity and customer satisfaction. When critical systems remain operational despite component failures, organizations avoid costly downtime, maintain service level agreements, and protect their reputation. For incident teams, high availability reduces the frequency and severity of incidents they must manage.

## Example Of High Availability

A cloud service provider implements high availability by deploying applications across multiple data centers. When a hardware failure occurs in one location, traffic automatically routes to healthy servers in another data center. Users experience no service interruption while the incident team addresses the underlying issue.
