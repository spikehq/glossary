## What Is Service Mapping

Service Mapping is the process of documenting relationships between business services and their underlying IT components. It creates a visual representation of how infrastructure elements connect to deliver specific services, showing dependencies and potential failure points.

## Why Is Service Mapping Important

Service Mapping helps incident responders quickly understand the broader impact of component failures. It speeds up root cause analysis, enables accurate impact assessment, and helps prioritize incidents based on business criticality. This visibility reduces mean time to resolution.

## Example Of Service Mapping

A payment processing service map shows connections to the database cluster, API gateway, authentication service, and third-party payment providers. When the database experiences performance issues, the map helps responders immediately identify all affected services and their business importance.

## How To Implement Service Mapping

- Inventory all business services and IT components
- Document dependencies between components
- Use automated discovery tools to maintain accuracy
- Include external dependencies and third-party services
- Create visual representations accessible during incidents
- Update maps when infrastructure changes occur

## Best Practices

- Start with your most critical business services
- Combine automated discovery with manual verification
- Keep service maps simple enough to be useful during high-pressure incidents
