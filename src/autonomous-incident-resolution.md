## What Is Autonomous Incident Resolution

Autonomous Incident Resolution is an advanced incident management approach where systems automatically detect, diagnose, and resolve incidents without human intervention. It uses AI, machine learning, and predefined remediation scripts to fix problems before they impact users or require manual attention from IT teams.

## Why Is Autonomous Incident Resolution Important

Autonomous Incident Resolution dramatically reduces downtime by eliminating the delay between detection and resolution. It frees up IT staff from handling routine issues, allows 24/7 incident management regardless of staff availability, and creates consistent resolution outcomes for known issues.

## Example Of Autonomous Incident Resolution

When a cloud server reaches 95% memory utilization, an autonomous system automatically identifies idle processes, terminates them based on predefined rules, and then verifies the server has returned to normal operationâ€”all without human intervention.

## How To Implement Autonomous Incident Resolution

- Start with simple, well-understood incidents that have clear resolution paths
- Build a knowledge base of common incidents and their proven solutions
- Implement AI systems that can recognize incident patterns
- Create automated remediation scripts with proper safeguards
- Establish monitoring to track autonomous resolution success rates
