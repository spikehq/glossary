## What Is Business Continuity

Business Continuity is the capability of an organization to maintain essential functions during and after a disaster or major incident. It encompasses planning and preparation to ensure operations can continue with minimal disruption when incidents occur.

## Why Is Business Continuity Important

Business Continuity protects organizations from existential threats. It minimizes downtime, financial losses, and reputational damage during major incidents. Effective business continuity planning helps companies recover quickly from disruptions and maintain customer trust.

## Example Of Business Continuity

After a regional power outage affects a company's primary data center, their business continuity plan activates automatically. Critical workloads fail over to a secondary data center, employees shift to remote work protocols, and customer-facing services continue with minimal interruption.

## How To Implement Business Continuity

- Conduct a business impact analysis to identify critical functions
- Develop recovery strategies for different incident scenarios
- Create detailed continuity plans with clear roles and procedures
- Train staff on their responsibilities during continuity events
- Test plans regularly through tabletop exercises and simulations

## Best Practices

- Update continuity plans whenever systems or processes change
- Focus resources on protecting your most critical business functions
- Involve representatives from all departments in continuity planning
