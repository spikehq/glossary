## What Is Automated Response

Automated response in incident management is a system-driven reaction to detected incidents based on predefined rules and workflows. It includes automatic alerts, ticket creation, initial diagnostics, and in some cases, remediation steps—all triggered without human intervention.

## Why Is Automated Response Important

Automated response reduces the critical time between incident detection and initial action. It standardizes the initial response process, ensures consistent handling of similar incidents, and allows teams to focus on complex resolution tasks rather than repetitive procedures.

## Example Of Automated Response

When a payment processing service fails, the monitoring system automatically creates an incident ticket, notifies the appropriate on-call engineer via SMS, collects relevant logs, restarts the affected service, and updates the status page—all within seconds of detecting the issue.
