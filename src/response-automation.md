## What Is Response Automation

Response automation refers to the use of technology to automatically execute predefined actions when an incident occurs, without requiring human intervention. It streamlines incident management by triggering immediate responses to alerts based on established rules and workflows, reducing manual effort and accelerating resolution times.

## Why Is Response Automation Important

Response automation dramatically reduces the time between incident detection and initial response. It eliminates human delay factors, maintains consistency in incident handling, and frees up technical teams to focus on complex issues that require human judgment. This leads to faster resolution times and more reliable service delivery.

## Example Of Response Automation

When a database server reaches 90% CPU utilization, an automated response system detects the threshold breach, creates an incident ticket, restarts non-critical services, scales up resources, and notifies the database team—all within seconds of the initial alert.

## How To Implement Response Automation With Spike

- Go to Playbooks in Spike and create a new one.
- Pick the trigger event, like when a new incident is created.
- Add actions such as sending alerts, running scripts, or updating status pages.
- Set conditions to match incident type, priority, or keywords.
- Save and activate your Playbook. It will now run automatically when triggered.
