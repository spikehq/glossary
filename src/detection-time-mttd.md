## What Is Detection Time (MTTD)

Detection Time, often measured as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), is the average time between when an incident occurs and when it is discovered by the organization. This metric reflects how quickly your monitoring systems and processes can identify problems that affect your services or infrastructure.

## Why Is Detection Time Important

Fast detection time directly impacts your ability to resolve incidents quickly. The longer an issue goes undetected, the more damage it can cause to your systems and customer experience. Reducing MTTD helps minimize downtime, preserve customer trust, and lower the overall business impact of incidents.

## Example Of Detection Time

A company's website experiences a database slowdown at 2:00 AM. Their monitoring system detects the issue at 2:07 AM, resulting in a detection time of 7 minutes. This quick detection allows the on-call team to address the problem before most customers are affected.
