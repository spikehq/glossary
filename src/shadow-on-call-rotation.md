## What Is Shadow On-Call Rotation

Shadow on-call rotation lets new team members observe experienced engineers during on-call shifts without full responsibility. This helps them learn incident response in real situations.

## Why Is Shadow On-Call Rotation Important

Shadow rotations give new staff real-world training and build confidence. They improve team readiness without risking incident response quality.

## How To Implement Shadow On-Call Rotation

- Pair new hires with experienced on-call engineers
- Let shadows join incident calls and discussions
- Gradually increase their involvement as they learn
- Collect feedback from both the shadow and the mentor
- Move shadows to active rotation when ready
