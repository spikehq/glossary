## What Is Algorithmic Incident Classification

Algorithmic Incident Classification uses machine learning algorithms to automatically categorize incidents based on their characteristics, severity, and potential impact. This approach helps standardize incident handling and route issues to the right teams without manual intervention.

## Why Is Algorithmic Incident Classification Important

Proper classification ensures incidents receive appropriate attention and resources. Algorithmic classification removes human bias and inconsistency, speeds up triage, and improves routing accuracy. It helps organizations maintain consistent service levels and prioritize effectively during high-volume incident periods.

## Example Of Algorithmic Incident Classification

When a new incident is reported, the classification algorithm analyzes the description, affected systems, and user impact. It automatically assigns the incident as a "Priority 2 Network Connectivity Issue" and routes it to the network operations team based on patterns learned from thousands of previous incidents.

## How To Implement Algorithmic Incident Classification

- Build a training dataset from historical, correctly classified incidents
- Select and train machine learning models on this dataset
- Implement a confidence threshold for automatic vs. human review
- Deploy the system with human oversight initially
- Continuously improve the model with feedback loops

## Best Practices

- Use a diverse training dataset that covers all incident types
- Include regular model retraining as new incident patterns emerge
- Maintain human oversight for unusual or critical incidents
