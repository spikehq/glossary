## Who Is On-Call Responder

An on-call responder is a designated IT professional responsible for acknowledging, investigating, and resolving incidents that occur during their assigned shift. They serve as the first line of defense against service disruptions outside regular business hours.

## Why Is On-Call Responder Important

On-call responders minimize incident impact by providing rapid response when issues arise. Their expertise and quick action prevent minor issues from escalating into major outages, protecting business operations and customer experience even during off-hours.

## Example Of On-Call Responder

At midnight, an on-call responder receives an alert about increasing error rates in the payment processing system. They quickly identify a memory leak in the application, restart the affected services, and implement a temporary fix until a permanent solution can be deployed during business hours.
