## What Is Blockchain Incident Monitoring

Blockchain Incident Monitoring is the practice of tracking and responding to security events, performance issues, and anomalies in blockchain networks and applications. It involves specialized tools to monitor distributed ledger transactions, smart contracts, and network consensus.

## Why Is Blockchain Incident Monitoring Important

Blockchain Incident Monitoring helps protect digital assets and transactions in decentralized systems. It detects potential security breaches, identifies performance bottlenecks, and maintains the integrity of blockchain applications that often handle sensitive or valuable data.

## Example Of Blockchain Incident Monitoring

A financial services company detects an unusual pattern of smart contract interactions that could indicate an exploit attempt. Their monitoring system alerts the security team, who quickly analyze the transactions and deploy a patch to prevent potential fund loss.

## How To Implement Blockchain Incident Monitoring

- Deploy specialized blockchain monitoring tools that understand consensus mechanisms
- Create custom alerts for smart contract vulnerabilities and unusual transaction patterns
- Monitor both on-chain activities and supporting infrastructure
- Establish baselines for normal transaction volumes and gas usage
- Integrate blockchain monitoring with your existing incident management platform

## Best Practices

- Monitor for both technical issues and economic attacks specific to blockchain systems
- Develop response playbooks for common blockchain incidents like 51% attacks or flash loan exploits
- Create a dedicated team with blockchain expertise for incident investigation and response
