## What Is Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)

Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) is the average time between when an incident actually begins and when it is detected by monitoring systems or users. This metric measures how quickly your organization identifies problems after they occur.

## Why Is MTTD Important

MTTD directly affects incident impact. Faster detection leads to faster resolution and less damage. This metric helps organizations evaluate the effectiveness of their monitoring tools and observability practices.

## Example Of MTTD

A database begins experiencing performance degradation at 9:15 AM. At 9:23 AM, monitoring alerts trigger based on slow query response times. The MTTD is 8 minutes.

## How To Track MTTD

- Deploy comprehensive monitoring across all critical systems
- Configure alerts with appropriate thresholds for early detection
- Use anomaly detection to identify unusual patterns
- Track incident start times through system logs and user reports
- Calculate and review MTTD regularly across incident categories

## Best Practices

- Implement real-time monitoring for critical services
- Use synthetic monitoring to detect issues before users do
- Create redundant detection methods for critical systems
