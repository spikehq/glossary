## What Is a False Alarm

A false alarm in incident management is an alert triggered by something other than a real incident or threat. It signals a problem when there is none, often due to system errors or misconfigured monitoring tools.

## Example of a False Alarm

A monitoring system sends an alert about high CPU usage. On investigation, the spike was caused by a scheduled backup, not a real problem.

## How to Reduce False Alarms

- Regularly review and update alert rules to match current systems
- Investigate each false alarm to find the root cause
- Adjust thresholds and filters to reduce unnecessary alerts
- Keep a log of false alarms to spot patterns
- Train team members to recognize and report false alarms
