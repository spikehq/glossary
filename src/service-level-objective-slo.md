## What Is Service Level Objective (SLO)

A Service Level Objective (SLO) is a target value or range for a service level that is measured by a Service Level Indicator (SLI). In incident management, SLOs define the goals for incident response and resolution performance.

## Why Is Service Level Objective (SLO) Important

SLOs translate SLIs into concrete performance targets. They help teams set realistic goals, prioritize improvements, and balance reliability with innovation. SLOs provide a clear benchmark for assessing service quality and guiding incident management strategies.

## Example Of Service Level Objective (SLO)

An SLO for incident response might be "99% of high-severity incidents will be acknowledged within 15 minutes." This sets a specific, measurable target for the incident management team.
