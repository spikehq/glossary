## What Is Single Point Of Failure

A single point of failure (SPOF) is any part of a system that, if it fails, will cause the entire system or service to stop working. In incident management, SPOFs are risks that can lead to major outages.

## Why Is Identifying Single Point Of Failure Important

Identifying SPOFs helps teams improve reliability and reduce the risk of major incidents. Removing SPOFs makes systems more resilient to failures.

## Example Of Single Point Of Failure

A company runs its website on a single server. If that server fails, the website goes down for all users.

## How To Implement Single Point Of Failure Analysis

- Map out all system components and dependencies
- Identify parts with no backup or redundancy
- Prioritize fixing the most critical SPOFs

## Best Practices

- Add redundancy for critical components
- Regularly review systems for new SPOFs
- Document all known SPOFs and mitigation plans
