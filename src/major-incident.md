## What Is Major Incident

A Major Incident is a high-impact, high-urgency event that causes significant disruption to business operations or services. It typically affects multiple users or critical systems, requires immediate response, and often involves cross-team coordination to resolve. Major incidents demand heightened attention and specialized handling procedures beyond routine issues.

## Example Of Major Incident

A payment processor experiences a database failure during Black Friday, preventing customers from completing purchases across hundreds of e-commerce sites. The company immediately declares a major incident, assembles a response team, and works to restore service while communicating updates to affected merchants.
