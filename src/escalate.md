## What is Escalate

Escalate means transferring an incident to a team or individual with more expertise, authority, or resources. This happens when the current responder cannot resolve the issue effectively or within the required timeframe.

## Why is Escalating an Incident Important

Escalation gets the right people involved when needed. It speeds up resolution for complex or high-impact incidents. It also prevents delays when the initial responders lack the necessary skills or permissions.

## Example of Escalating an Incident

A support agent receives a report about a slow application. Basic troubleshooting doesn't fix it. The agent escalates the incident to the specialized application development team for deeper investigation.

## How To Escalate

- Define clear criteria for when to escalate (e.g., time limits, severity)
- Establish specific escalation paths for different incident types
- Notify the next level responder or team clearly
- Transfer all relevant incident context and diagnostic information
- Confirm the receiving team has accepted responsibility

## Best Practices

- Define clear triggers and pathways for escalation in advance
- Pass along all relevant context and troubleshooting steps already taken
- Set clear timeframes for each support level before escalation occurs
