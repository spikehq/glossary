## What Is Microservices Monitoring

Microservices Monitoring is the practice of tracking the health, performance, and interactions of individual microservices within a distributed application architecture to detect issues and understand system behavior.

## Why Is Microservices Monitoring Important

Microservices architectures create complex dependencies that are difficult to troubleshoot. Effective monitoring provides visibility into service interactions, helps identify the root cause of issues across service boundaries, and supports rapid incident response in distributed systems.

## Example Of Microservices Monitoring

An e-commerce platform notices increased latency in their checkout process. Their microservices monitoring shows that the payment service is experiencing delays when calling the inventory service. Tracing reveals a database query bottleneck in the inventory service affecting the entire transaction flow.

## How To Implement Microservices Monitoring

- Implement distributed tracing across all services
- Collect both technical and business metrics from each service
- Create service maps to visualize dependencies
- Set up health checks and synthetic transactions
- Establish baseline performance metrics for each service

## Best Practices

- Monitor both individual service health and end-to-end transactions
- Implement correlation IDs to track requests across multiple services
- Focus on anomaly detection rather than static thresholds in dynamic environments
