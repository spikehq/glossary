## What Is System Failure

System failure is when a critical part of your IT infrastructure stops working as expected. This can halt key services or disrupt business operations until the issue is fixed.

## Example Of System Failure

A payment gateway goes offline during peak hours, stopping all customer transactions until engineers restore the service.

## How To Implement System Failure Response

- Set up monitoring to detect failures quickly
- Define clear incident response steps for your team
- Keep backup systems or failover solutions ready
- Communicate updates to stakeholders during outages
- Review each failure to improve future responses

## Best Practices

- Test your backup and recovery processes regularly
- Document all incident responses for future learning
- Train your team to handle high-pressure situations calmly
