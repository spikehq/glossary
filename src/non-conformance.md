## What Is Non-Conformance

Non-conformance in incident management refers to a deviation from established policies, procedures, or standards during incident handling. It occurs when teams fail to follow documented processes, miss required steps, or bypass controls designed to maintain service quality and security during incident response.

## Why Identifying Non-Conformance Important

Identifying and addressing non-conformance helps organizations maintain consistent incident management practices. Unchecked non-conformance can lead to longer resolution times, repeated incidents, compliance violations, and security risks. Tracking these deviations provides valuable insights for process improvement and training needs.

## Example Of Non-conformance

During a critical system outage, an IT engineer implements an unauthorized configuration change to restore service quickly, bypassing the required change approval process. While the fix works, the lack of documentation and testing creates risk and violates the organization's incident management procedures.
