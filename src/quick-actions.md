## What Are Quick Actions

Quick Actions are predefined, one-click operations that allow incident responders to perform common tasks without navigating through multiple screens or systems. They streamline incident response by reducing the time and effort needed for routine actions during incident management.

## Why Are Quick Actions Important

Quick Actions reduce the cognitive load on responders during stressful incidents. They speed up response time by eliminating manual steps and reducing context switching between tools. Standardized quick actions also promote consistent handling of similar incidents across different responders.

## Example Of Quick Actions

An on-call engineer receives an alert about a web server issue. From the alert interface, they use Quick Actions to restart the service, check recent logs, and notify stakeholdersâ€”all without logging into multiple systems or writing custom commands.

## How To Implement Quick Actions

- Identify the most common actions taken during incident response
- Create automation scripts or API integrations for these actions
- Build a simple interface for triggering these actions with minimal clicks
- Test quick actions thoroughly in non-production environments
- Document each quick action with clear descriptions of what they do

## Best Practices

- Limit quick actions to reversible operations that won't cause additional harm
- Include confirmation steps for potentially disruptive actions
- Review and update quick actions regularly based on changing systems and needs
