## What Is Change Management

Change Management is a structured approach to implementing and tracking modifications to IT systems, infrastructure, or processes. It helps control how changes are introduced to minimize disruption and reduce the risk of incidents caused by changes.

## Why Is Change Management Important

Change Management prevents incidents by controlling how and when changes occur in your environment. It creates visibility around modifications, allows for proper testing, and provides rollback options if problems arise. Effective change management significantly reduces the number of incidents caused by poorly implemented changes.

## Example of Change Management

A company plans to update their authentication system. Instead of making changes directly in production, they submit a change request, conduct risk assessment, test in staging environments, schedule the change during low-traffic hours, and have a rollback plan ready. The change proceeds smoothly with minimal user impact.

## How to Implement Change Management

- Create a change advisory board to review proposed changes
- Develop a standardized change request process with risk assessment
- Implement change calendars to prevent conflicting modifications
- Establish testing requirements before changes reach production
- Create post-change verification procedures

## Best Practices

- Schedule regular change windows for non-emergency updates
- Implement automated testing for common changes
- Document all changes with detailed before/after states for troubleshooting
