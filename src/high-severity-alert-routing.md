## What Is High-Severity Alert Routing

High-Severity Alert Routing is a process that automatically directs critical alerts to the appropriate response teams based on predefined rules and severity levels. It prioritizes the most urgent incidents, sending them to specialized responders while bypassing standard queues to minimize response time for system-critical issues.

## Why Is High-Severity Alert Routing Important

High-Severity Alert Routing reduces the time between detection and response for critical incidents. It prevents important alerts from getting lost among less urgent notifications and helps teams focus their immediate attention on issues that could cause significant damage or downtime.

## Example of High-Severity Alert Routing

When a payment processing system fails, the monitoring system detects the outage and classifies it as high-severity. The alert routing system immediately notifies the primary on-call engineer, the payments team lead, and the CTO simultaneously, while creating a dedicated incident channel in Slack.

## How To Implement High-Severity Alert Routing With Spike

- Set up alert rules in Spike to detect high-severity incidents using keywords or severity tags.
- Route these alerts to your critical escalation policy so all key responders get notified at once.
- Use multi-channel notificationsâ€”send urgent alerts by phone call or SMS, and less urgent ones to Slack or Teams.
- Automate workflows with Playbooks to handle routine incidents and keep focus on high-severity cases.
- Link runbooks and create dedicated Slack channels for critical incidents to speed up response.
