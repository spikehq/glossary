## What Are Burnout Prevention Algorithms

Burnout prevention algorithms are computational systems that analyze on-call workloads, incident response patterns, and team metrics to identify potential responder burnout before it occurs. These algorithms flag concerning patterns and recommend interventions to maintain team health.

## Why Are Burnout Prevention Algorithms Important

Incident response teams face high-stress situations that can lead to burnout, decreased performance, and turnover. These algorithms help organizations protect their most valuable asset—their people—by distributing workload fairly and identifying unsustainable patterns before they cause harm.

## Example Of Burnout Prevention Algorithms

An algorithm detects that a DevOps engineer has handled seven high-severity incidents in the past two weeks, with three occurring outside business hours. It automatically suggests temporarily removing them from the primary on-call rotation and recommends a backup responder.

## How To Implement Burnout Prevention Algorithms

- Collect data on incident frequency, timing, duration, and responder assignments
- Define thresholds for workload metrics like after-hours incidents and consecutive on-call shifts
- Create automated alerts when thresholds are approached or exceeded
- Integrate with on-call scheduling systems for automatic rotation adjustments
- Establish clear escalation paths when burnout risks are identified

## Best Practices

- Include team input when setting workload thresholds and intervention triggers
- Balance team-level and individual-level metrics to catch both personal and systemic issues
- Respect privacy by focusing on workload patterns rather than performance judgments
