## What Is Dependency Mapping

Dependency mapping is the process of identifying and documenting relationships between IT services, applications, and infrastructure components. It creates a visual representation of how systems depend on each other, helping teams understand the potential impact radius when incidents occur.

## Why Is Dependency Mapping Important

Dependency mapping helps incident responders quickly identify which services might be affected during an outage. When teams understand system relationships, they can prioritize their response efforts, predict cascading failures, and communicate more accurately with stakeholders about impact scope.

## Example Of Dependency Mapping

A payment processing service depends on a database cluster, authentication service, and network infrastructure. When the database experiences an outage, the dependency map shows that payment processing will fail, but user logins will still work since they only rely on the authentication service.

## How To Implement Dependency Mapping

- Document all critical services and their connections
- Use automated discovery tools to identify hidden dependencies
- Create visual maps showing relationship hierarchies
- Update maps regularly as systems change
- Integrate mapping data with your incident management platform

## Best Practices

- Start with your most critical business services and work backward
- Include both technical and business dependencies
- Keep maps simple enough to be useful during high-stress incidents
