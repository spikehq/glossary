## What Is Secondary Responder

A secondary responder is a backup team member who steps in if the primary on-call responder cannot address an incident. This role helps maintain incident response continuity.

## Why Is Secondary Responder Important

Secondary responders prevent gaps in incident coverage. If the primary responder misses or cannot handle an alert, the secondary responder steps in to resolve the issue quickly.

## Example Of Secondary Responder

If the primary on-call engineer does not acknowledge a critical alert within 10 minutes, the alert escalates to the secondary responder.
