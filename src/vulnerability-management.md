## What Is Vulnerability Management

Vulnerability management is a structured, continuous process that identifies, assesses, prioritizes, and remedies security weaknesses in IT systems before they can be exploited. It includes scanning for vulnerabilities, evaluating their severity, implementing fixes, and verifying that remediation efforts were successful.

## Why Is Vulnerability Management Important

Effective vulnerability management reduces your organization's overall risk exposure by systematically addressing security weaknesses. It helps prevent data breaches, maintains compliance with security regulations, and provides visibility into your security posture. A proactive approach to vulnerabilities is more effective than reacting to incidents after they occur.

## Example Of Vulnerability Management

An organization implements automated scanning tools that regularly check their network for known vulnerabilities. When a critical vulnerability is detected in their web server software, the system automatically alerts the security team. They evaluate the risk, apply the appropriate patch during a scheduled maintenance window, and verify the fix was successful.

## How To Implement Vulnerability Management

- Identify assets and create an inventory of all systems that need protection
- Deploy vulnerability scanning tools to regularly check for weaknesses
- Establish a process for evaluating and prioritizing vulnerabilities based on risk
- Develop clear remediation workflows for addressing different types of vulnerabilities
- Implement verification procedures to confirm that fixes are effective

## Best Practices

- Create a risk-based approach to prioritization, focusing on vulnerabilities that pose the greatest threat
- Integrate vulnerability management with other security processes like incident response
- Maintain continuous monitoring rather than relying on periodic scans
