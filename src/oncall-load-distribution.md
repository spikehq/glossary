## What Is On-Call Load Distribution

On-call load distribution is the practice of spreading incident response duties evenly across team members. This prevents burnout and keeps incident management effective.

## Why Is On-Call Load Distribution Important

Evenly distributed on-call duties help maintain team morale and reduce fatigue. It also makes sure that no single person is overloaded, which leads to faster and more reliable incident responses.
