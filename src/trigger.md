## What Is Trigger

A trigger in incident management is an event or condition that initiates an automated response or alert. Triggers detect abnormal system behavior and prompt incident creation based on predefined thresholds or conditions.

## Why Is Trigger Important

Triggers enable rapid detection of incidents before they impact users. They automate the initial response process, reduce detection time, and help teams prioritize issues based on severity and impact.

## Example of Trigger

A monitoring system detects CPU usage exceeding 90% for more than five minutes on a critical server. This triggers an alert that automatically creates an incident ticket and notifies the on-call engineer via SMS.

## How to Implement Trigger

- Identify key metrics and thresholds that indicate potential issues
- Configure monitoring tools to detect these conditions
- Set up notification channels for different trigger types
- Create automated workflows for initial response steps
- Regularly review and refine trigger conditions

## Best Practices

- Set appropriate thresholds to avoid alert fatigue from false positives
- Configure different notification channels based on trigger severity
- Regularly review trigger effectiveness and adjust as systems evolve
