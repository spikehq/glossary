## What Is Alert Filtering

Alert filtering is a process that screens incoming alerts based on predefined criteria to reduce noise and highlight significant notifications. It helps incident management teams focus on critical issues by removing duplicate, irrelevant, or low-priority alerts before they reach responders.

## Why Is Alert Filtering Important

Alert filtering prevents alert fatigue by reducing the volume of notifications that reach on-call teams. It helps organizations maintain focus on truly important incidents, improves response times to critical issues, and reduces burnout among incident responders.

## Example Of Alert Filtering

A cloud infrastructure team sets up filters to suppress notifications about CPU spikes below 85% during business hours but allows all CPU alerts during peak traffic periods. This reduces non-actionable alerts while maintaining visibility for potential problems.

## How To Implement Alert Filtering With Spike

- Set up filters in Spike to block low-priority or irrelevant alerts before they reach your team.
- Use integration settings to send alerts only for specific outcomes, like failed builds or high-severity incidents.
- Adjust severity and priority levels so only important alerts trigger notifications.
- Spike groups repeated incidents and suppresses alerts while an incident is open, cutting down noise.
- You can fine-tune filters for each integration, matching your team’s needs.
