## What Is Deduplication

Deduplication in incident management is the process of identifying and combining duplicate alerts or incidents to reduce noise and prevent multiple teams from working on the same issue. It helps consolidate related events into a single actionable incident.

## Why Is Deduplication Important

Alert fatigue is a serious problem in incident management. Deduplication reduces the volume of notifications, helps teams focus on unique issues, prevents wasted effort on duplicate work, and creates a clearer picture of system health by eliminating redundant information.

## Example Of Deduplication

A server failure triggers alerts from five different monitoring systems. Instead of creating five separate incidents, the deduplication system recognizes they share the same root cause and creates a single incident ticket with all relevant information consolidated.
