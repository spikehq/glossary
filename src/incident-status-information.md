## What Is Incident Status Information

Incident Status Information is real-time data about the current state of an incident, including its severity, affected systems, resolution progress, and estimated time to resolution. This information helps teams track incident lifecycle and keeps stakeholders informed about ongoing issues and their impact.

## Why Is Incident Status Information Important

Incident Status Information creates transparency across the organization during critical events. It reduces duplicate inquiries, allows teams to coordinate effectively, and helps stakeholders make informed decisions about business continuity. Clear status updates also build trust with customers and prevent speculation.

## Example Of Incident Status Information

During a payment processing outage, the status information might include: "High severity incident affecting checkout systems. Engineering team identified database connection issue at 14:30. Estimated resolution time: 2 hours. Workaround available for urgent transactions through backup payment gateway."
