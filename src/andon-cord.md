## What Is Andon Cord

An Andon Cord is a concept from lean manufacturing adapted for incident management, representing a mechanism that allows any team member to halt operations when they detect a critical issue. In incident management, it's a protocol that empowers employees to escalate and trigger an immediate response to prevent further damage.

## Why Is Andon Cord Important

The Andon Cord concept creates a culture where anyone can raise an alarm about critical issues without fear. It prevents small problems from escalating into major incidents by enabling quick intervention. This approach distributes responsibility for system health across the entire team rather than limiting it to managers or specific roles.

## Example Of Andon Cord

A junior developer notices unusual database query patterns that might indicate a security breach. Instead of waiting for confirmation or escalating through normal channels, they "pull the Andon Cord" by triggering a high-priority alert, which immediately notifies the security team and potentially prevents a data breach.
