## What Is Graph-Based Dependency Mapping

Graph-based Dependency Mapping is a visualization technique that uses graph theory to represent relationships between IT systems, services, and infrastructure components. It creates a network diagram showing how different elements depend on each other, helping teams understand the potential impact radius of incidents.

## Why Is Graph-Based Dependency Mapping Important

Graph-based Dependency Mapping helps incident responders quickly identify which systems might be affected by an outage. When an incident occurs, teams can trace dependencies to understand the full scope of impact and prioritize their response efforts. This approach reduces the time spent investigating affected systems and enables more targeted remediation.

## Example Of Graph-based Dependency Mapping

When a database server experiences performance issues, the graph map shows all applications that depend on this database. The incident team immediately sees that the customer portal, inventory system, and payment processor are all at risk, allowing them to focus on the most critical services first.

## How To Implement Graph-based Dependency Mapping

- Collect dependency data through automated discovery tools and manual input
- Choose a graph database or visualization tool that supports relationship modeling
- Start with critical services and map their immediate dependencies
- Add depth gradually by mapping dependencies of dependencies
- Update the graph regularly as your infrastructure changes

## Best Practices

- Include both technical and business service dependencies in your mapping
- Use automation to keep dependency maps current as environments change
- Create different views for different audiencesâ€”technical details for engineers, service impact for management
