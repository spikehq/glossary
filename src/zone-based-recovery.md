## What Is Zone-Based Recovery

Zone-Based Recovery is a disaster recovery approach that divides systems or infrastructure into distinct zones based on criticality, geography, or function. Each zone has tailored recovery procedures, priorities, and objectives. This strategy allows organizations to isolate failures and recover critical systems first while maintaining clear boundaries between affected and operational areas.

## Why Is Zone-Based Recovery Important

Zone-Based Recovery improves disaster response by enabling targeted, prioritized recovery efforts. Organizations can allocate resources more efficiently by focusing on the most critical zones first. This approach also helps contain incidents within specific zones, preventing cascading failures across the entire infrastructure and reducing overall recovery time and business impact.

## How To Implement Zone-Based Recovery

- Identify and classify different zones based on business criticality and dependencies
- Define specific recovery objectives and procedures for each zone
- Establish clear isolation mechanisms between zones to prevent failure propagation
- Create zone-specific recovery teams with defined responsibilities
- Develop communication protocols for coordination between zone recovery efforts
- Test recovery procedures for each zone independently and collectively

## Best Practices

- Document dependencies between zones to understand potential cascade effects
- Prioritize recovery based on business impact rather than technical considerations
- Regularly test zone isolation to verify effectiveness during actual incidents

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Overlooking dependencies between zones that might complicate recovery
- Creating too many zones, which can lead to coordination challenges
- Failing to update zone definitions as the organization's infrastructure evolves

## KPIs For Zone-Based Recovery

- Recovery time for each zone compared to its recovery time objective
- Percentage of successful zone isolation during recovery exercises
- Number of incidents contained within their original zone
