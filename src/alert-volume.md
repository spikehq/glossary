## What Is Alert Volume

Alert volume is the total number of alerts generated by monitoring or incident management systems over a specific period. It helps teams understand their workload and the noise level in their alerting process.

## Why Is Tracking Alert Volume Important

Tracking alert volume helps teams spot patterns, reduce alert fatigue, and focus on real issues. High alert volume can signal too many false alarms or poorly tuned monitoring.

## How To Implement Alert Volume Tracking

- Use monitoring tools that log all alerts
- Set up dashboards to visualize alert counts over time
