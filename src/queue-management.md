## What Is Queue Management

Queue Management is the systematic process of organizing, prioritizing, and tracking incidents as they move through the resolution lifecycle. It involves monitoring workloads, assigning incidents to appropriate responders, and preventing bottlenecks in the incident resolution process.

## Why Is Queue Management Important

Effective queue management prevents high-priority incidents from being buried under less critical issues. It distributes workload fairly among team members and provides visibility into bottlenecks. Good queue management leads to predictable resolution times and better resource allocation.

## Example Of Queue Management

During a major outage, the incident commander notices that the database team's queue has grown to 15 incidents while the network team has only 2. They temporarily reassign some network engineers to help with database issues, balancing the workload and speeding up overall resolution.

## How To Implement Queue Management

- Establish clear queue ownership and management responsibilities
- Create dashboards showing queue health and bottlenecks
- Implement automatic prioritization based on business impact
- Set up alerts for queue thresholds (like too many P1 incidents)
- Schedule regular queue reviews to prevent aging incidents

## Best Practices

- Train team leads to regularly groom their queues and reassign work as needed
- Use data from queue performance to inform staffing and training decisions
- Implement a "swarming" approach for critical incidents rather than queuing them
