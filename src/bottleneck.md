## What Is Bottleneck In Incident Management

A Bottleneck in incident management is a point in the response process that limits overall efficiency and extends resolution time. It occurs when one component, process, or resource cannot handle the volume or speed required, causing delays in incident resolution.

## Why Is Identifying Bottleneck Important In Incident Management

Identifying bottlenecks helps organizations improve their incident response efficiency. By addressing these constraints, teams can significantly reduce resolution times, minimize service impact, and improve overall incident management performance.

## Example of Bottleneck In Incident Management

A company discovers that all major incidents require approval from a single senior manager before remediation can begin. This approval process frequently adds 30+ minutes to resolution times, even during critical outages.

## How to Identify Bottlenecks In Incident Management

- Map your entire incident response workflow from detection to resolution
- Measure time spent at each stage of the process
- Analyze incidents with longer-than-average resolution times
- Gather feedback from responders about process pain points
- Use incident management tools to track response metrics automatically

## Best Practices

- Regularly review incident metrics to spot emerging bottlenecks
- Empower teams with appropriate authority to reduce approval delays
- Create redundancy for critical roles and resources
