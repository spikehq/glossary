## What Is Support Tier

Support tiers in incident management are hierarchical levels of technical expertise and authority used to organize incident response. Typically structured as Tier 1 (frontline support), Tier 2 (specialized technical support), and Tier 3 (expert engineering), each level handles increasingly complex problems.

## Why Is Support Tier Important

Tiered support structures efficiently distribute workload based on incident complexity. This approach allows organizations to resolve simple issues quickly while directing complex problems to specialists, optimizing resource usage and improving resolution times.

## Example Of Support Tier

A cloud service provider uses three tiers: Tier 1 handles basic customer issues and initial triage, Tier 2 addresses specific service disruptions requiring technical expertise, and Tier 3 consists of senior engineers who tackle complex infrastructure problems affecting multiple systems.

## How To Implement Support Tier

- Define clear responsibilities and authority for each tier
- Establish escalation criteria between tiers
- Create knowledge bases tailored to each tier's needs
- Implement tracking to monitor escalation patterns
- Train staff on appropriate escalation procedures

## Best Practices

- Document clear handoff procedures between tiers to prevent information loss
- Avoid unnecessary escalations by empowering lower tiers with proper tools
- Regularly rotate staff between tiers to build organizational knowledge
