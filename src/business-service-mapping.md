## What Is Business Service Mapping

Business Service Mapping is the process of documenting relationships between IT components and the business services they support. It creates a visual representation showing how infrastructure elements connect to business functions, helping teams understand the business impact of technical incidents.

## Why Is Business Service Mapping Important

Business Service Mapping helps incident responders prioritize issues based on business impact rather than technical severity alone. It enables faster triage by showing which customers or services are affected by specific infrastructure problems, leading to more strategic incident management decisions.

## Example Of Business Service Mapping

When a database server fails, the mapping immediately shows that it supports the payment processing service used by 70% of customers. This visibility helps the incident team prioritize this issue over other concurrent incidents with less business impact.

## How To Implement Business Service Mapping

- Document all critical business services and their components
- Identify dependencies between infrastructure and business functions
- Use visualization tools to create relationship maps
- Keep mappings updated as infrastructure changes
- Integrate mapping data with your incident management platform

## Best Practices

- Start with your most critical business services first
- Include both technical and business stakeholders in the mapping process
- Update maps automatically when possible to prevent outdated information
