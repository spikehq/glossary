## What Is Vendor Management

Vendor management is the process of selecting, overseeing, and maintaining relationships with third-party service providers. In incident management, it involves coordinating with vendors to prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents that may arise from vendor interactions or affect vendor-supplied services.

## Why Is Vendor Management Important

Effective vendor management reduces the risk of incidents caused by third-party vulnerabilities. It helps maintain service continuity, protects sensitive data shared with vendors, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements. Good vendor management also improves incident response times when vendor-related issues occur.

## How To Implement Vendor Management

- Create a comprehensive vendor inventory
- Develop clear vendor selection criteria and onboarding processes
- Establish service level agreements (SLAs) with incident response provisions
- Implement regular vendor performance reviews and risk assessments
- Set up a system for tracking and managing vendor incidents

## Best Practices

- Maintain open communication channels with key vendor contacts
- Include vendors in incident response drills and simulations
- Regularly update vendor risk profiles and adjust management strategies accordingly
