## What Is Noise Reduction

Noise reduction in incident management is the practice of filtering out unnecessary alerts and notifications to focus on meaningful signals. It involves eliminating duplicate alerts, correlating related issues, and suppressing known false positives.

## Why Is Noise Reduction Important

Noise reduction prevents alert fatigue among incident responders. It helps teams focus on genuine issues that require attention, improves response times for critical incidents, and reduces the risk of important alerts being overlooked amid the noise.

## Example Of Noise Reduction

Instead of generating 50 separate alerts when a server cluster experiences issues, a noise reduction system correlates these into a single incident with detailed context. This prevents the on-call engineer from being overwhelmed with notifications.
