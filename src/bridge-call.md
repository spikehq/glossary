## What Is Bridge Call

A Bridge Call is a conference call that brings together incident responders and stakeholders during an active incident. It provides a real-time communication channel for teams to share updates, coordinate response efforts, and make decisions to resolve the incident quickly.

## Why Is Bridge Call Important

Bridge Calls create a centralized communication hub during critical incidents. They eliminate information silos, reduce confusion, and speed up decision-making when every minute counts. These calls help maintain a shared understanding of the incident status across different teams and locations.

## Example Of Bridge Call

During a major service outage, the incident commander initiates a bridge call with the database team, network engineers, and customer support. Together, they identify a database connection issue, develop a fix, and coordinate customer communicationsâ€”all while maintaining a continuous line of communication.

## How To Conduct Bridge Call

- Establish a dedicated conference line or virtual meeting room for incidents
- Define clear roles for participants (incident commander, scribe, subject matter experts)
- Create a structured agenda to keep discussions focused
- Document key information and decisions in real-time
- Set up recording capabilities for post-incident review

## Best Practices

- Keep bridge calls focused on resolution, not blame
- Bring in subject matter experts only when needed
- Document action items and decisions as they happen
