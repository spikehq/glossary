## What Are Notification Templates

Notification templates are standardized formats for incident alerts that contain predefined content, structure, and placeholders for incident-specific information. They provide consistent, clear communication about incidents to various stakeholders.

## Why Are Notification Templates Important

Notification templates save time during incidents by eliminating the need to craft messages from scratch. They improve communication clarity by ensuring all essential information is included and help maintain a professional tone even during stressful situations.

## Example Of Notification Templates

A template for a major outage notification includes placeholders for the affected service, impact description, estimated resolution time, and workaround instructions. When an incident occurs, these fields are automatically populated with relevant details.

## How To Create Notification Templates

- Identify different notification types needed (initial alert, update, resolution)
- Create templates for various incident types and severity levels
- Include clear placeholders for dynamic information
- Test templates with stakeholders to ensure clarity
- Refine templates based on feedback and actual usage

## Best Practices

- Keep templates concise and focused on essential information
- Use plain language that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- Include clear next steps or expectations in each notification
