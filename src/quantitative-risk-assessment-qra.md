## What Is Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)

Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) in incident management is a method of evaluating risks using numerical and statistical techniques. It assigns numerical values to the likelihood and impact of potential incidents, allowing for more precise risk prioritization.

## Why Is Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) Important

QRA provides a more objective basis for risk management decisions. It helps organizations allocate resources more effectively, prioritize risk mitigation efforts, and make informed decisions about acceptable risk levels.

## Example Of Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)

A company uses QRA to assess the risk of data breaches. They calculate the probability of a breach occurring and the potential financial impact, helping them decide on appropriate security investments.

## How To Do Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA)

- Identify potential risks and their sources
- Gather data on incident likelihood and potential impact
- Use statistical methods to calculate risk probabilities
- Assign monetary values to potential impacts where possible
- Prioritize risks based on their calculated values

## Best Practices

- Use reliable data sources for accurate assessments
- Regularly update risk assessments as conditions change
- Combine QRA with qualitative assessments for a comprehensive view
