## What Is Uptime

Uptime is the total time a system, service, or application remains operational and available for use. It represents the reliability of IT infrastructure and is typically measured as a percentage of the total possible operating time. High uptime indicates stable, dependable systems.

## Why Is Uptime Important

Uptime directly reflects service reliability and availability to users. High uptime builds trust with customers and prevents revenue loss from service disruptions. For critical systems, even minutes of downtime can have significant operational and financial consequences.

## Example Of Uptime

A company's customer support portal maintains 99.95% uptime over a year. This means the system was unavailable for only about 4.38 hours throughout the entire year, demonstrating excellent reliability and minimal disruption to support operations.

## How To Implement Uptime Monitoring

- Deploy monitoring tools that continuously check system availability
- Set up automated alerts for any availability issues
- Implement redundant systems and failover mechanisms
- Create dashboards showing real-time and historical uptime metrics
- Regularly review uptime reports to identify patterns or recurring issues

## Best Practices

- Design systems with redundancy and fault tolerance from the beginning
- Conduct planned maintenance during low-traffic periods to minimize impact
- Implement progressive rollouts of changes to catch issues before they affect all users

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Focusing only on server uptime while ignoring application performance issues
- Setting unrealistic uptime goals without the infrastructure to support them
- Neglecting dependencies that can affect overall system availability

## KPIs For Uptime

- Uptime percentage (daily, monthly, yearly)
- Number and duration of outages
- Time between failures
- Service availability during peak usage periods
