## What Is Incident Lifecycle

The incident lifecycle is the complete sequence of stages an incident goes through from initial detection to final resolution and review. It typically includes identification, logging, categorization, prioritization, response, resolution, and post-incident analysis.

## Why Understanding Incident Lifecycle Important

Understanding the incident lifecycle provides structure to incident management processes. It helps teams track progress, assign responsibilities at each stage, and maintain consistency in how incidents are handled. A well-defined lifecycle improves coordination and reduces resolution time.

## Example Of Incident Lifecycle

A payment processing failure is identified (identification), recorded in the incident management system (logging), classified as a critical service disruption (categorization), assigned highest priority (prioritization), addressed by the response team (response), fixed through a database rollback (resolution), and analyzed in a postmortem meeting (review).
