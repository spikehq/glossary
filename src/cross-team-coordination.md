## What Is Cross-team Coordination In Incident Management

Cross-team coordination in incident management involves orchestrating efforts between different functional groups to resolve incidents efficiently. It includes establishing communication channels, defining handoff procedures, and creating shared understanding across organizational boundaries.

## Why Is Cross-team Coordination Important In Incident Management

Modern technology stacks span multiple domains and specialties. Few incidents can be resolved by a single team working in isolation. Effective cross-team coordination reduces resolution time, prevents duplicate efforts, and ensures all aspects of an incident are addressed properly.

## Example Of Cross-team Coordination In Incident Management

A customer-facing application experiences performance issues. The incident requires coordination between the application team, database administrators, network engineers, and customer support. Each team handles their domain while maintaining communication about progress and dependencies.
