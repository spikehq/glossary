## What Are Multi-channel Notifications

Multi-channel Notifications are incident alerts delivered through various communication methods simultaneously or sequentially based on predefined rules. Channels may include email, SMS, phone calls, mobile apps, collaboration tools, and desktop notifications.

## Why Are Multi-channel Notifications Important

Multi-channel Notifications increase the likelihood of reaching responders quickly during incidents. They provide redundancy when primary communication methods fail, accommodate different team preferences, and escalate through increasingly intrusive channels for critical issues.

## Example Of Multi-channel Notifications

When a critical database failure occurs, the incident management system sends an initial alert via Slack. If not acknowledged within 5 minutes, it sends an SMS. After another 5 minutes without response, it initiates a phone call that continues until someone acknowledges the incident.
