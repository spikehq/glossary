## What Is Virtual Responder

A Virtual Responder is a digital entity or automated system that responds to incidents without human intervention. It uses predefined protocols to acknowledge alerts, initiate preliminary response actions, and collect relevant information before human responders become involved in incident management.

## Why Is Virtual Responder Important

Virtual Responders reduce response time for critical incidents by providing immediate acknowledgment and initial triage. They help combat alert fatigue by handling routine incidents automatically, allowing human responders to focus on complex issues that require their expertise and judgment.

## Example Of Virtual Responder

During a server outage, a Virtual Responder automatically acknowledges the alert, runs diagnostic scripts to collect system logs, and initiates predetermined recovery procedures like service restarts. It then routes this information to the appropriate human responder with context about actions already taken.

## How To Build Virtual Responder

- Identify common incidents that follow predictable patterns
- Create response playbooks with clear decision trees
- Implement automation tools that can execute these playbooks
- Integrate with your incident management platform
- Set up proper handoff protocols for escalation to human responders

## Best Practices

- Program Virtual Responders to collect comprehensive diagnostic information before escalating
- Regularly update response protocols based on incident post-mortems
- Maintain clear documentation of automated actions for human responders who take over
