## What Is Priority Matrix

A priority matrix in incident management is a visual tool that helps teams categorize incidents based on their impact and urgency. It typically uses a grid format with axes representing impact (severity) and urgency (time sensitivity) to determine the appropriate priority level for each incident.

## Why Is Priority Matrix Important

A priority matrix removes subjectivity from incident classification. It creates a standardized approach to prioritization, helps teams make consistent decisions under pressure, and aligns response efforts with business needs. This clarity speeds up triage and improves resource allocation.

## Example Of Priority Matrix

A cloud service provider uses a 4Ã—4 matrix where the x-axis shows impact (minor to critical) and y-axis shows urgency (low to high). A database failure affecting all customers falls in the high-impact, high-urgency quadrant (P1), while a non-critical internal tool issue falls in the low-impact, low-urgency quadrant (P4).

## How To Create Priority Matrix

- Define the axes (typically impact and urgency)
- Create clear definitions for each level on both axes
- Assign priority levels to each cell in the matrix
- Document examples for each priority level
- Train all responders on using the matrix during triage

## Best Practices

- Keep the matrix simple with 3-5 levels on each axis
- Include business impact considerations, not just technical severity
- Review and refine the matrix periodically based on real incident data
