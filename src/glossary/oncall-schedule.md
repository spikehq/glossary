## What Is On-Call Schedule

An on-call schedule is a formal rotation plan that designates which team members are responsible for responding to incidents during specific time periods. It distributes the responsibility of after-hours support across the team while providing clear accountability for incident response.

## Why Is On-Call Schedule Important

A well-designed on-call schedule prevents burnout by distributing the on-call burden fairly among team members. It creates clarity about who handles incidents at any given time, eliminates confusion during emergencies, and helps maintain work-life balance for technical staff.

## Example Of On-Call Schedule

A cloud infrastructure team implements a weekly rotation where each engineer serves as primary on-call for one week, with another team member as backup. The schedule automatically adjusts for holidays and allows trades between team members when needed.
