## What Is Proactive Incident Response

Proactive incident response is an approach that focuses on preventing incidents before they occur rather than just reacting to them. It involves monitoring systems for warning signs, addressing potential issues early, and continuously improving infrastructure resilience based on risk assessments.

## Why Is Proactive Incident Response Important

Proactive incident response significantly reduces downtime and service disruptions by catching issues early. It lowers operational costs, improves customer satisfaction, and reduces team burnout by preventing middle-of-the-night emergencies.

## Example Of Proactive Incident Response

A streaming service notices increasing latency in their authentication service. Rather than waiting for it to fail, they proactively migrate traffic to backup systems, investigate the root cause, and implement a fix during regular business hours without any user impact.

## How To Implement Proactive Incident Response

- Deploy comprehensive monitoring across all critical systems
- Establish baseline performance metrics and set early warning thresholds
- Create runbooks for addressing common warning signs
- Conduct regular risk assessments and scenario planning
- Implement automated remediation for known issues

## Best Practices

- Develop a "pre-mortem" mindset by imagining what could go wrong
- Review near-misses (almost-incidents) with the same rigor as actual incidents
- Build a culture that rewards identifying and addressing potential issues
