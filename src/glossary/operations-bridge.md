## What Is Operations Bridge

Operations Bridge is a centralized function that provides real-time monitoring, coordination, and management of IT services across an organization. It serves as the nerve center for detecting, triaging, and coordinating responses to incidents that affect business services.

## Why Is Operations Bridge Important

The Operations Bridge provides visibility across complex IT environments, enabling faster incident detection and resolution. It connects siloed teams, coordinates responses to multi-faceted issues, and maintains a holistic view of service health that individual teams might miss.

## Example Of Operations Bridge

A financial services company's Operations Bridge detects performance degradation across multiple systems. The team correlates these issues to a network problem affecting several applications, coordinates with network specialists to resolve it, and keeps stakeholders informed throughout the incident.

## How To Build Operations Bridge

- Integrate monitoring tools from across the organization
- Staff with personnel who understand the entire IT landscape
- Establish clear communication channels with all technical teams
- Define escalation procedures and decision-making authority
- Create dashboards that show service health at a glance

## Best Practices

- Focus on business service impact rather than just technical metrics
- Implement event correlation to identify related issues
- Maintain regular communication with service owners and technical teams
