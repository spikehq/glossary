## What Is Resolution Tracking

Resolution tracking is the process of monitoring and documenting the progress of incident remediation from detection to closure. It provides visibility into the current status of each incident, who's working on it, what actions have been taken, and how long the resolution is taking.

## Why Is Resolution Tracking Important

Resolution tracking creates accountability and transparency in incident management. It helps teams prioritize their work, prevents incidents from being forgotten, and provides data for improving response processes. Without proper tracking, incidents may fall through the cracks or take longer to resolve.

## Example Of Resolution Tracking

A cloud service provider experiences an API outage. Their resolution tracking system logs when the incident was detected, who acknowledged it, what troubleshooting steps were taken, when a fix was implemented, and when service was fully restored. This timeline becomes valuable during the post-incident review.

## How To Implement Resolution Tracking

- Choose an incident management platform with built-in tracking capabilities
- Define clear status categories (detected, acknowledged, investigating, mitigating, resolved)
- Assign ownership for each incident with clear handoff procedures
- Document all actions taken during the resolution process
- Set up automated status updates to stakeholders

## Best Practices

- Update incident status in real-time to maintain accurate visibility
- Include time stamps for all status changes to measure response efficiency
- Link resolution steps to your knowledge base to build institutional memory
