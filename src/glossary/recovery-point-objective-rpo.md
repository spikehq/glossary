## What Is Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time. It defines how much data an organization can afford to lose during an incident before significant harm occurs to the business.

## Why Is Recovery Point Objective (RPO) Important

RPO helps organizations design appropriate backup strategies and allocate resources effectively. It balances the cost of data protection against business risk, allowing teams to implement solutions that meet specific data loss tolerance requirements.

## Example Of Recovery Point Objective (RPO)

A financial services company sets an RPO of 5 minutes for its transaction processing system. This means they implement continuous data replication to ensure that, in the event of a failure, no more than 5 minutes of transaction data would be lost.
