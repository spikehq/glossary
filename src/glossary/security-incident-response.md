## What Is Security Incident Response

Security Incident Response is a structured approach to handling and managing the aftermath of a security breach or cyberattack. It involves a set of procedures to identify, contain, and mitigate threats to an organization's information systems and data.

## Why Is Security Incident Response Important

Effective security incident response minimizes damage from cyber threats, reduces recovery time, and helps prevent future incidents. It protects sensitive data, maintains business continuity, and upholds an organization's reputation in the face of security breaches.

## Example Of Security Incident Response

A company detects unauthorized access to its customer database. The incident response team immediately isolates the affected systems, investigates the breach source, and works to patch the vulnerability while notifying affected customers.
