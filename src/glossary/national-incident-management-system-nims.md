## What Is National Incident Management System (NIMS)

The National Incident Management System (NIMS) is a standardized approach to incident management developed by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. It provides a consistent framework for government, private sector, and non-governmental organizations to work together during disasters and emergencies, regardless of size, location, or complexity.

## Why Is National Incident Management System (NIMS) Important

NIMS establishes common terminology, organizational structures, and operational procedures that enable effective coordination during incidents. For organizations managing critical infrastructure or public services, NIMS alignment improves collaboration with emergency responders and government agencies during major incidents that require multi-agency response.
