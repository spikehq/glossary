## What Is Zero Touch Automation

Zero Touch Automation refers to the complete automation of IT operations and management tasks with the goal of eliminating human intervention. It merges intelligent automation driven by AI with IT service desk and operations functions, conforming to industry standard IT service management frameworks such as ITIL. This approach uses machine learning and big data to help IT operations deliver greater business value.

## Why Is Zero Touch Automation Important

Zero Touch Automation reduces manual effort, minimizes human error, and speeds up IT processes. It allows IT teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than repetitive tasks. This approach is becoming essential as IT environments grow more complex and the pace of business demands faster service delivery and problem resolution.

## Example Of Zero Touch Automation

An organization implements Zero Touch Automation for their network management. When a new device needs to be added to the network, the system automatically detects it, applies appropriate security policies, configures necessary settings, and adds it to the monitoring systemâ€”all without human intervention.

## Types Of Zero Touch Automation

- IT service desk automation - Automated ticket routing, categorization, and resolution
- Network automation - Self-configuring network devices and automated troubleshooting
- Security automation - Automated threat detection, analysis, and response
- Infrastructure automation - Automated provisioning and management of IT resources

## How To Implement Zero Touch Automation

- Identify repetitive, rule-based processes suitable for automation
- Map out current workflows and decision points
- Select appropriate automation tools that integrate with existing systems
- Start with simple processes and gradually expand to more complex ones
- Build in feedback mechanisms to continuously improve automation

## Best Practices

- Focus on processes with clear rules and decision points first
- Build robust error handling into automated workflows
- Maintain human oversight for critical systems and decisions

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Attempting to automate too many processes too quickly
- Neglecting to document automated processes
- Failing to build in proper security controls

## KPIs For Zero Touch Automation

- Percentage reduction in manual interventions
- Mean time to resolution for automated processes
- Cost savings from automated operations
- Error rate reduction compared to manual processes
