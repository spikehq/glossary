## What Is Zero-Noise Alerting

Zero-Noise Alerting is a methodological approach designed to focus security operations center (SOC) attention on the most important alerts while continuously improving detection systems to reduce false positives. This approach aims to eliminate alert fatigue by creating high-fidelity alerts that trigger only for genuine threats, getting as close as possible to the ideal of zero noise in alert systems.

## Why Is Zero-Noise Alerting Important

Alert fatigue is a major challenge in cybersecurity, especially in cloud environments. Security teams face overwhelming volumes of alerts, making it difficult to identify truly malicious activity. Zero-Noise Alerting helps teams focus on genuine threats by reducing false positives and low-value alerts, improving incident response times and effectiveness.

## Example Of Zero-Noise Alerting

A financial services company implemented Zero-Noise Alerting after suffering multiple successful attacks. By focusing on transaction management servers and creating tailored high-priority detections for irregular activities, they successfully detected and blocked subsequent compromise attempts without generating noise. They also removed noisy detections on DMZ servers, saving hours of daily SOC work.
