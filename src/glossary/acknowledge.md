## What Is Acknowledge In Incident Management

Acknowledge is the act of confirming receipt of an incident alert and taking initial ownership of the response. It's the first step in the incident management process where a responder indicates they are aware of the issue and will begin working on it.

## Example Of Acknowledge In Incident Management

A system monitoring tool detects high CPU usage and sends an alert to the on-call engineer. The engineer receives the notification on their phone, taps the "acknowledge" button, and the incident management system records the time and updates the incident status from "triggered" to "acknowledged."
