## What Is Known Error

A Known Error is a problem within an IT system that has been identified and analyzed. Often, its root cause and a temporary workaround are known, but a permanent solution is not yet available. It represents a documented issue awaiting a final fix.

## Importance Of Known Error

Recognizing Known Errors helps IT teams resolve recurring incidents faster using documented workarounds. It links ongoing disruptions back to their underlying cause, aiding problem management efforts. This avoids repeated diagnosis for the same issue.

## Example Of Known Error

A software application crashes due to a specific bug when processing large files. The team knows the bug exists and has a workaround (process smaller files separately). Until the bug is fixed in a future release, this is a Known Error.
