## What Are Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) are metrics used to provide early warning signals that the probability or potential impact of a risk is increasing beyond an organization's tolerance level. They help predict potential problems before they happen.

## Why Are Key Risk Indicators (KRIs) Important

KRIs enable proactive risk management by highlighting emerging threats or vulnerabilities. They offer advance notice, help prioritize risk mitigation efforts, provide insights into control effectiveness, and support better decision-making.

## Example Of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

For a financial services company, a KRI might be the 'Percentage of transactions flagged for potential fraud'. If this percentage trends upward toward a predefined threshold, it signals an increasing risk that requires investigation and potential action. Other examples include 'Patch compliance rate below 95%' or 'Employee absenteeism exceeding 5%'.

## Types Of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

KRIs can span various business areas:

- **Financial:** Liquidity ratios, debt levels, revenue concentration
- **Operational:** Equipment downtime rates, process error rates, supply chain delays
- **Technology:** System latency, cybersecurity patch levels, backup success rates
- **People:** Employee turnover rates, critical skill gaps, employee satisfaction scores
- **Compliance:** Number of regulatory violations, audit findings

## How To Implement Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

- Understand your organization's key objectives and risk appetite
- Identify the critical risks that could significantly impact those objectives
- Define specific, measurable indicators that provide early warning for these risks
- Set clear thresholds for each KRI that trigger alerts or action
- Establish processes for monitoring KRI data and reporting exceptions

## Best Practices

- Ensure KRIs are forward-looking and predictive, not just historical data
- Link KRIs directly to strategic objectives and critical risks
- Regularly review and adjust KRIs and their thresholds to remain relevant

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Selecting too many KRIs, diluting focus
- Using lagging indicators that only report past events
- Setting thresholds too high (missing warnings) or too low (causing noise)
