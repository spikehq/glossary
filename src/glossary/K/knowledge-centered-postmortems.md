## What Are Knowledge-Centered Postmortems

Knowledge-Centered Postmortems are reviews conducted after an incident that focus specifically on capturing, structuring, and sharing the knowledge gained. The goal is to make lessons learned easily accessible and reusable for future incident prevention and response.

## Why Are Knowledge-Centered Postmortems Important

These postmortems turn incident resolution experiences into valuable, reusable assets for the entire organization. They help teams learn collectively, improve response processes, prevent repeat incidents, and reduce the time needed to solve similar issues in the future.

## Example Of Knowledge-Centered Postmortems

After a website outage, the response team holds a postmortem. They identify a misconfiguration as the root cause. Instead of just fixing it, they document the symptoms, the steps taken to diagnose, the final fix, and preventative measures in a structured knowledge article. This article is then added to their searchable knowledge base.

## How To Implement Knowledge-Centered Postmortems

- Use a standard postmortem template focused on knowledge capture
- Document what was learned, not just what happened
- Link the incident findings to existing knowledge articles or create new ones
- Have peers review the captured knowledge for clarity and accuracy
- Integrate knowledge creation and search into the incident management workflow

## Best Practices

- Treat knowledge as a collective asset, encouraging contribution and reuse
- Keep the process blameless, focusing on system improvements, not individual errors
- Make sure the captured knowledge is easy to find and apply during future incidents

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Creating overly complex or bureaucratic documentation processes
- Failing to integrate knowledge sharing into daily workflows
- Allowing the knowledge base to become outdated or untrustworthy
