## What Are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are measurable values that demonstrate how effectively an organization is achieving key business objectives in incident management. They provide quantifiable metrics to evaluate success in meeting targets for incident response, resolution times, and overall system reliability.

## Why Are Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Important

KPIs provide objective measurements to track incident management performance over time. They help teams identify areas for improvement, justify resource allocation, and demonstrate the value of incident management processes to stakeholders and leadership.

## Example Of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

A cloud service provider uses MTTR (Mean Time to Resolve) as a KPI. Their target is to resolve critical incidents within 45 minutes. Monthly reports show they're averaging 38 minutes, indicating they're meeting their goal with room to spare.

## Types Of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Time-based KPIs: MTTA, MTTR, MTTD
- Volume-based KPIs: Number of incidents, repeat incidents
- Quality-based KPIs: Customer satisfaction, SLA compliance
- Cost-based KPIs: Cost per incident, downtime costs

## How To Implement Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Identify objectives that align with business goals
- Select metrics that directly measure progress toward these objectives
- Set realistic targets based on historical data and industry benchmarks
- Implement tools to collect and analyze KPI data automatically
- Review KPIs regularly and adjust targets as needed

## Best Practices

- Limit your focus to 5-7 KPIs that truly matter to avoid data overload
- Make KPIs visible to the entire team to foster accountability
- Review and refine your KPIs periodically as business needs evolve

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Choosing too many KPIs, which dilutes focus and creates reporting overhead
- Focusing solely on quantitative metrics while ignoring qualitative aspects
- Setting unrealistic targets that demoralize teams rather than motivate them
