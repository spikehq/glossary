## What Is Knowledge Automation In Incident Resolution

Knowledge Automation in Incident Resolution uses technology, often including AI and machine learning, to automatically apply documented knowledge and procedures to diagnose and fix incidents without requiring human intervention.

## Why Is Knowledge Automation In Incident Resolution Important

It significantly speeds up incident resolution, reducing Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR). This lowers the impact of incidents, ensures consistent application of fixes, and frees up skilled personnel to handle more complex or novel issues.

## Example Of Knowledge Automation In Incident Resolution

A monitoring system detects a full disk drive on a server. An automation engine queries the knowledge base, finds the standard procedure for clearing temporary files, executes the script, verifies disk space is freed up, and resolves the incident ticket automatically.

## How To Implement Knowledge Automation In Incident Resolution

- Build a high-quality, structured knowledge base with resolution procedures
- Develop automation scripts or runbooks for common fixes
- Use AI/ML tools to match incoming incidents to appropriate knowledge articles and automations
- Integrate automation tools with monitoring systems and infrastructure control planes
- Implement safeguards, approvals, and monitoring for automated actions

## Best practices

- Start by automating resolutions for frequent, low-risk, well-understood incidents
- Maintain rigorous quality control for the knowledge base fueling automation
- Always include verification steps to confirm the automated fix was successful

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Automating tasks that require complex judgment or are poorly understood
- Triggering automation based on inaccurate or outdated knowledge
- Insufficient testing or monitoring of automated remediation actions

## KPIs For Knowledge Automation In Incident Resolution

- Percentage of incidents resolved through automation
- Reduction in MTTR for automatically resolved incidents
- Success rate of automated resolution attempts
