## What Is Time To Detect

Time to Detect, or Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), measures the average time elapsed between when an incident begins and when your team first detects or identifies it.

## Why Is Time To Detect Important

Faster detection allows for a quicker response. Reducing the time it takes to find an issue minimizes its potential impact and damage. It is a crucial first step in the incident lifecycle.

## Example Of Time To Detect

A website error starts occurring at 2:00 PM. Monitoring systems automatically generate an alert received by the on-call engineer at 2:07 PM. The Time to Detect for this incident is 7 minutes.
