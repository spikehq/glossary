## What Is Knowledge Base

A Knowledge Base is a centralized repository of information that contains documented solutions, troubleshooting guides, FAQs, and best practices for resolving incidents. It serves as a self-service resource for incident responders to quickly find relevant information during an incident.

## Why Is Knowledge Base Important

A Knowledge Base reduces incident resolution time by providing immediate access to proven solutions. It preserves institutional knowledge, promotes consistency in incident handling, and helps new team members get up to speed quickly on common issues and their resolutions.

## Example Of Knowledge Base

During a critical database outage, an on-call engineer consults the knowledge base and finds a documented solution from a similar incident three months ago. The engineer applies the same fix, resolving the issue in minutes instead of hours.

## Types Of Knowledge Base

- **Internal knowledge bases** for staff and responders
- **External knowledge bases** for customers and users
- **Procedural knowledge bases** focused on processes and workflows
- **Technical knowledge bases** containing detailed technical information
