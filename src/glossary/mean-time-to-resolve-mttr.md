## What Is Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR)

Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) is the average time between when an incident is detected and when it is fully resolved. This metric measures the total lifecycle of an incident from discovery to complete resolution, including diagnosis and repair time.

## Why Is MTTR Important

MTTR directly reflects the efficiency of your incident response process. Lower MTTR means less downtime and business impact. This comprehensive metric helps organizations evaluate their overall incident management effectiveness.

## Example Of MTTR

A critical application crashes at 10:00 AM. After diagnosis and fixes, service is fully restored at 11:30 AM. The MTTR is 90 minutes.

## How To Implement MTTR Tracking

- Record precise start and end times for all incidents
- Calculate MTTR across different incident categories and severities
- Compare MTTR trends over time to measure improvement
- Break down MTTR into component phases to identify bottlenecks
- Set realistic MTTR targets based on service level objectives

## Best Practices

- Develop and refine incident response playbooks
- Conduct regular training for response teams
- Implement automated remediation for common issues
