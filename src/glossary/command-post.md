## What Is Command Post

A Command Post is a designated physical or virtual location where incident response leaders gather during major incidents to coordinate activities, make decisions, and communicate with stakeholders. It serves as the central hub for information flow and strategic direction during crisis situations.

## Why Is Command Post Important

A Command Post creates a unified command structure during complex incidents. It improves coordination, speeds up decision-making, and centralizes communication. Without a command post, response efforts often become fragmented, leading to confusion, duplicated efforts, and delayed resolution.
