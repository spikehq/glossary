## What Are Instant Notifications

Instant Notifications are immediate alerts sent to incident responders through multiple channels when an incident is detected. These time-sensitive communications deliver critical information about the incident to prompt rapid response and resolution.

## Why Are Instant Notifications Important

Instant Notifications reduce detection-to-response time for critical incidents. They help organizations meet service level agreements and minimize downtime costs. Timely alerts also prevent incidents from escalating into more severe problems that affect customers.

## Example Of Instant Notifications

A payment gateway failure triggers simultaneous alerts to the on-call engineer via SMS, mobile app push notification, and phone call. The notification includes the error code, affected systems, and a direct link to the incident dashboard.
