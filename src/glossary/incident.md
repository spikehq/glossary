## What Is Incident

An incident is an unplanned interruption, degradation, or failure of a service, system, or infrastructure component that impacts business operations or users. In incident management, it represents any event that disrupts normal service delivery and requires intervention to resolve.

## Example Of Incident

A payment processing system experiences a 30% increase in transaction failures during peak shopping hours. This is classified as a high-priority incident because it directly impacts revenue and customer experience. The incident triggers automated alerts and brings together a response team to investigate and resolve the issue.
