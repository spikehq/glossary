## What Is Incident Closure

Incident closure is the final stage in the incident management lifecycle where an incident is formally marked as resolved after confirming the issue has been fixed and normal service has been restored. It includes documenting the resolution, collecting feedback, and archiving relevant information.

## Why Is Incident Closure Important

Proper incident closure creates a clear endpoint for each incident, prevents issues from falling through the cracks, and builds a knowledge base for future reference. It helps measure resolution effectiveness and provides data for continuous improvement in incident management processes.

## Example Of Incident Closure

After resolving a network outage, the incident response team verifies all affected services are functioning normally, documents the root cause (failed router) and solution (hardware replacement), notifies stakeholders of resolution, and marks the incident as closed in their incident management system.

## How To Implement Incident Closure With Spike

- Open the incident in Spike and click the Resolve button to mark it as closed.
- Add a resolution note to document what was fixed and how.
- Notify stakeholders by updating the incident or using integrated status pages.
- Spike logs the closure, keeping a full history for future reference.
