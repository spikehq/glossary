## What Is Incident Monitoring

Incident Monitoring is the continuous observation of systems, networks, and applications to detect and track incidents. It involves using tools and processes to identify anomalies, errors, or performance issues that could indicate an incident.

## Why Is Incident Monitoring Important

Effective incident monitoring allows organizations to detect issues early, reducing response times and minimizing impact. It provides real-time visibility into system health and helps prevent minor issues from escalating into major incidents.

## Example of Incident Monitoring

A monitoring system detects a sudden spike in server CPU usage and automatically alerts the on-call team, allowing them to investigate and address the issue before it affects users.

## How to Implement Incident Monitoring

- Select and deploy appropriate monitoring tools
- Define key metrics and thresholds
- Set up alerting mechanisms
- Establish a process for reviewing and acting on alerts
- Continuously refine monitoring parameters

## Best Practices

- Use a combination of automated and manual monitoring techniques
- Implement centralized logging for easier analysis
- Regularly review and update monitoring thresholds and rules
