## What Is an Incident Model

An Incident Model is a standardized framework for categorizing and responding to different types of incidents. It defines the steps, roles, and procedures for handling specific incident scenarios, ensuring consistent and efficient responses.

## Why Is an Incident Model Important

Incident Models provide a structured approach to incident management. They help teams respond more quickly and effectively, reduce errors, and improve overall incident resolution times.

## Example of an Incident Model

A company's incident model for network outages includes steps for initial assessment, team mobilization, root cause analysis, and service restoration, with defined roles for each stage.

## How to Build an Incident Model

- Identify common incident types in your organization
- Define clear steps for each incident type
- Assign roles and responsibilities
- Document the model and train staff
- Regularly review and update the model

## Best Practices

- Keep the model flexible to adapt to unique situations
- Align the model with industry best practices and standards
- Regularly test the model through simulations or drills
