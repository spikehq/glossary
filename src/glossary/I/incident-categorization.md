## What Is Incident Categorization

Incident categorization is the process of classifying incidents based on their nature, impact, and urgency to facilitate proper handling and resolution. It involves assigning incidents to predefined categories that help teams prioritize, route, and respond to issues efficiently within an incident management system.

## Why Is Incident Categorization Important

Incident categorization enables teams to quickly identify the right responders and resources needed for resolution. It creates consistency in how incidents are handled, supports accurate reporting and trend analysis, and helps organizations improve their incident response over time.

## Example Of Incident Categorization

A cloud service provider categorizes incidents as: Infrastructure (server outages, network issues), Application (software bugs, API failures), Security (unauthorized access, data breaches), and Customer Impact (affecting single vs. multiple customers). When a database server crashes, it's immediately categorized as "Infrastructure - High Impact" and routed to the database team.
