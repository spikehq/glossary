## What Is Intelligent Alert Routing

Intelligent Alert Routing is an automated system that directs incident alerts to the most appropriate responder or team based on factors like incident type, severity, affected systems, time of day, and responder expertise or availability.

## Why Is Intelligent Alert Routing Important

Intelligent Alert Routing reduces response time by immediately notifying the right people. It prevents alert fatigue by ensuring team members only receive relevant alerts. This targeted approach improves resolution efficiency and balances workload across teams.

## Example Of Intelligent Alert Routing

A database performance alert occurs at 2 AM. Instead of waking the entire on-call rotation, the system identifies that this specific database is managed by Team Alpha and routes the alert only to their database specialist who is currently on-call.

## How To Implement Intelligent Alert Routing

- Map your services and their owners in a service catalog
- Define routing rules based on incident attributes and team responsibilities
- Integrate with on-call schedules and availability status
- Create escalation paths for unacknowledged alerts
- Test routing logic regularly with simulated incidents

## Best Practices

- Start with simple routing rules and add complexity gradually
- Include context and troubleshooting information with routed alerts
- Review routing effectiveness quarterly and adjust based on resolution metrics
