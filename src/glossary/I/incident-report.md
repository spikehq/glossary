## What Is Incident Report

An incident report is a formal document that summarizes an incident after it has been resolved. It provides a comprehensive overview of what happened, how it was addressed, and what can be learned from the experience to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Why Is Incident Report Important

Incident reports transform raw incident data into actionable insights. They help organizations learn from past incidents, identify recurring issues, and improve response procedures. These reports also provide transparency to stakeholders and document the organization's commitment to continuous improvement.

## Example Of Incident Report

Following a service outage, a team creates a report detailing the root cause (network configuration error), impact (30 minutes of downtime affecting 5,000 users), resolution steps (configuration rollback), and preventive measures (implementing configuration validation checks).
