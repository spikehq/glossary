## What Is Incident Detection

Incident detection is the process of identifying events or conditions that indicate a potential service disruption, security breach, or system failure. It involves monitoring systems, analyzing alerts, and recognizing patterns that signal an incident requiring response.

## Why Is Incident Detection Important

Fast and accurate incident detection minimizes service disruptions by allowing teams to respond before issues escalate. It reduces downtime, limits business impact, and helps maintain service level agreements. Early detection often means simpler fixes and less extensive damage.

## Example Of Incident Detection

A monitoring system detects unusual CPU spikes on a production server and automatically generates an alert. The on-call engineer receives the notification, investigates the issue, and discovers a runaway process causing resource contention before it affects customer-facing services.
