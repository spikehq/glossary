## What Is Incident Logging

Incident logging is the process of creating a formal record of an incident in an incident management system. It captures essential details including the time of occurrence, affected systems, symptoms, impact, and initial categorization.

## Why Is Incident Logging Important

Proper incident logging creates a single source of truth for each incident. It provides the foundation for effective incident management, enables accurate tracking and reporting, and preserves critical information for analysis and knowledge sharing after resolution.

## Example Of Incident Logging

After receiving reports of slow response times on the checkout page, an engineer creates an incident ticket that includes the timestamp, affected service, user impact description, initial severity assessment, and links to relevant monitoring dashboards.
