## What Is Incident Identification

Incident identification is the process of recognizing events that disrupt normal operations and require a response. It involves detecting anomalies, errors, or failures in systems through monitoring tools, alerts, or user reports that indicate a potential incident has occurred.

## Why Is Incident Identification Important

Prompt incident identification reduces downtime and minimizes business impact. The faster you identify an incident, the quicker you can respond, potentially preventing minor issues from escalating into major problems. Early detection directly impacts resolution time and service availability.

## Example Of Incident Identification

A monitoring system detects unusual CPU usage on a database server and triggers an alert. The on-call engineer reviews the alert, confirms it's not a false positive, and formally identifies it as an incident requiring immediate attention.

## How To Implement Incident Identification With Spike

- Connect your monitoring tools to Spike using pre-built integrations.
- Spike collects alerts from all your sources into one central place.
- Review incoming alerts on the Spike dashboard or mobile app.
- Quickly confirm if an alert signals a real incident that needs action.
