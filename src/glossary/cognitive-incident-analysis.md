## What Is Cognitive Incident Analysis

Cognitive Incident Analysis is an advanced approach to understanding incidents that examines the mental processes, decision-making patterns, and cognitive factors that influenced how teams responded to problems. It goes beyond technical root causes to explore human factors in incident management.

## Why Is Cognitive Incident Analysis Important

This approach reveals how human thinking affects incident outcomes. It helps teams understand why certain decisions were made under pressure and identifies cognitive biases that might have delayed resolution. These insights lead to better training and decision-making protocols.

## Example Of Cognitive Incident Analysis

After a prolonged database outage, a team analyzes not just the technical failure but also why the on-call engineer initially misdiagnosed the problem. They discover that confirmation bias led them to pursue a familiar but incorrect solution path for the first 30 minutes.

## How To Conduct Cognitive Incident Analysis

- Interview all participants about their thought processes during the incident
- Map out decision points and alternatives that were considered
- Identify cognitive biases that may have influenced decisions
- Analyze communication patterns between team members
- Create training scenarios based on findings

## Best Practices

- Create a psychologically safe environment for honest reflection
- Focus on learning rather than blame or criticism
- Include perspectives from both technical and non-technical team members
