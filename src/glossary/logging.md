## What Is Logging

Logging is the practice of recording events, actions, and states within software applications and systems. It creates a chronological record of system activities that can be used for troubleshooting, auditing, and understanding system behavior during incidents.

## Why Is Logging Important

Logging provides the evidence needed to understand what happened during an incident. Without proper logging, incident responders must rely on guesswork rather than facts, making resolution slower and less effective.

## Example Of Logging

A payment processing system logs each step of a transaction: request received, validation performed, payment gateway contacted, response received, and confirmation sent. When a transaction fails, these logs help pinpoint exactly where the failure occurred.

## How To Do Logging

- Determine what events should be logged across your systems
- Implement structured logging with consistent formats
- Include contextual information like timestamps and request IDs
- Set appropriate logging levels (debug, info, warning, error)
- Store logs in a centralized, searchable repository

## Best Practices

- Include enough detail to be useful without logging sensitive data
- Use correlation IDs to track requests across distributed systems
- Balance logging verbosity with performance and storage considerations
