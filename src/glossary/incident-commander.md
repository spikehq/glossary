## What Is Incident Commander

An Incident Commander is the designated leader who manages the response to an incident. They coordinate all aspects of incident resolution, make critical decisions, delegate tasks, and serve as the central communication point throughout the incident lifecycle.

## Why Is Incident Commander Important

The Incident Commander provides clear leadership during high-stress situations, preventing confusion and ensuring organized response efforts. They maintain situational awareness, remove obstacles for responders, and keep stakeholders informed about incident status and progress.

## Example Of Incident Commander

During a major database outage, the Incident Commander establishes a virtual war room, assigns engineers to investigate specific components, coordinates with the communications team for customer updates, and makes the final call on implementing a database rollback to restore service.
