## What Is Failure Mode And Effects Analysis (FMEA)

Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a systematic approach to identify potential failures in systems, processes, or services before they occur. In incident management, FMEA helps teams anticipate what might go wrong, assess the potential impact, and develop preventive measures to reduce risk.

## Why Is Failure Mode And Effects Analysis (FMEA) Important

FMEA shifts incident management from reactive to proactive by identifying vulnerabilities before they cause problems. This approach reduces the frequency and severity of incidents, improves system reliability, and helps teams prioritize preventive actions based on risk. It creates a culture of prevention rather than firefighting.

## Example Of Failure Mode And Effects Analysis (FMEA)

An e-commerce company conducts an FMEA before the holiday shopping season. They identify that their payment processing system could fail under high transaction volumes. The team assigns this a high risk priority number based on severity, likelihood, and detection difficulty. They implement load balancing and additional monitoring as preventive measures.

## How To Conduct Failure Mode And Effects Analysis (FMEA)

- Assemble a cross-functional team with diverse expertise
- Identify potential failure modes for each system component
- Rate each failure mode by severity, occurrence probability, and detection difficulty
- Calculate risk priority numbers to prioritize preventive actions
- Develop and implement specific preventive measures for high-risk items

## Best Practices

- Review and update your FMEA regularly, especially after significant system changes
- Use historical incident data to inform your analysis and risk ratings
- Involve frontline operators who have hands-on experience with the systems
