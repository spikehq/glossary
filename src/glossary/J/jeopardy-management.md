## What Is Jeopardy Management

Jeopardy Management is the process of monitoring tasks within a plan to identify risks of falling behind schedule. It aims to predict and detect potential delays or SLA violations early. This allows teams to take corrective actions before deadlines are missed.

## Why Is Jeopardy Management Important

This process helps manage risks tied to task delays in projects or order fulfillment. It prevents schedule slips from jeopardizing timely completion. Early detection allows stakeholders to step in and correct the course.

## Example Of Jeopardy Management

Imagine a software release plan with multiple development stages. Jeopardy Management tools monitor progress against the schedule. If coding tasks run significantly late, the system flags a jeopardy condition. It predicts a missed release date and alerts the project manager to reallocate resources.

## How To Implement Jeopardy Management

- Continuously collect performance data for plan tasks
- Define expected timelines and SLA thresholds
- Use predictive models to forecast potential delays
- Set up automated alerts for predicted or actual jeopardy conditions
- Define clear actions to take when jeopardy is detected

## Best Practices

- Integrate jeopardy monitoring with project management or workflow tools
- Clearly define what constitutes a jeopardy condition
- Ensure timely notifications reach the right stakeholders

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Relying on inaccurate or incomplete performance data
- Setting unrealistic thresholds that trigger too many false alarms
- Failing to define clear corrective actions for jeopardy alerts

## KPIs For Jeopardy Management

- Number of accurately predicted jeopardy conditions
- Reduction in SLA violations or missed deadlines
- Time saved through early corrective actions
