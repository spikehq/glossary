## What Is Alert Fatigue

Alert fatigue is a condition where incident responders become desensitized to notifications due to receiving too many alerts, particularly false positives. This mental state causes responders to potentially miss critical alerts, respond more slowly, or make errors in judgment during incident management.

## Example Of Alert Fatigue

A DevOps engineer receives over 200 alerts during their shift, with 90% being false positives. When a critical database failure occurs, the engineer misses the alert because it blends in with the noise, resulting in extended downtime that could have been prevented.
