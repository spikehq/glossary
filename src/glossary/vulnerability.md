## What Is Vulnerability

A vulnerability is a weakness in a computer system, network, or application that can be exploited by cybercriminals to gain unauthorized access. These weaknesses may exist in software code, system configurations, or security practices, allowing attackers to run malicious code, install malware, or steal sensitive data.

## Why Understading Vulnerability Important

Understanding vulnerabilities is crucial for protecting your systems against potential attacks. Unaddressed vulnerabilities represent open doors for malicious actors, putting your organization's data, operations, and reputation at risk. Identifying vulnerabilities early allows you to patch them before they can be exploited.

## Example Of Vulnerability

A common example is SQL injection, where attackers insert malicious SQL code into input fields on a website. If the application doesn't properly validate user inputs, attackers can manipulate the database to extract sensitive information or gain administrative access to the system.
