## What Is Event Management

Event management is the process of identifying, analyzing, and addressing events that could impact IT services or business operations. It involves monitoring systems, detecting anomalies, and coordinating responses to maintain service quality and minimize disruptions.

## Why Is Event Management Important

Effective event management helps organizations detect and resolve issues quickly, reducing downtime and improving service reliability. It provides visibility into system health and supports proactive problem-solving.
