## What Is On-Call Override

On-call override is a temporary adjustment to an on-call schedule that allows a different team member to take responsibility during a specific time period. This feature provides flexibility without permanently changing the established rotation pattern, making it ideal for handling planned absences, vacations, or unexpected personal commitments.

## Why Is On-Call Override Important

On-call overrides maintain continuous incident coverage when scheduled team members are unavailable. They provide flexibility to accommodate personal needs while keeping systems monitored. Overrides help teams adapt to changing circumstances without disrupting the entire schedule, creating a more supportive work environment and preventing gaps in incident response.

## Example Of On-Call Override

Deepa replaced Steven for all on-call shifts from January 1st to January 15th while Steven was on leave. The override was set up in advance with a single action, automatically adjusting all affected shifts in the schedule and notifying both team members of the change.
