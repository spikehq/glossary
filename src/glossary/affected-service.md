## What Is Affected Service

An Affected Service is any system, application, infrastructure component, or business function that experiences degraded performance or complete failure during an incident. It represents the scope of impact that an incident has on an organization's technical environment.

## Example Of Affected Service

During a network outage, the affected services might include the customer login system, payment processing, and inventory management. The support ticketing system remains operational because it runs on a separate network. This information helps the incident team prioritize restoring the payment processing service first due to its direct revenue impact.
