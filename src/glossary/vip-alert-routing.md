## What Is VIP Alert Routing

VIP Alert Routing is a specialized incident management process that directs alerts related to high-priority customers, executives, or critical systems to designated response teams or individuals. It creates separate handling paths for incidents that require heightened attention or specialized expertise.

## Why Is VIP Alert Routing Important

VIP Alert Routing helps organizations prioritize incidents that have outsized business impact. It reduces response time for critical customers or systems, demonstrates commitment to key stakeholders, and allows for specialized handling of high-visibility incidents by the most qualified responders.

## Example Of VIP Alert Routing

When a system outage affects a Fortune 500 client, VIP Alert Routing automatically escalates the incident to senior engineers and account managers, bypassing standard triage processes. It also triggers more frequent status updates to executives and the client's technical contacts.
