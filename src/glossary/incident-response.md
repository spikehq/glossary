## What Is Incident Response

Incident response is the organized approach to addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach, service disruption, or other unexpected event. It includes the detection, analysis, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.

## Why Is Incident Response Important

A structured incident response process helps organizations react quickly and effectively to minimize damage. It reduces downtime, limits financial impact, and protects reputation. Good incident response turns chaotic situations into manageable, methodical processes.

## Example Of Incident Response

A company detects unauthorized access to their customer database. Their incident response includes isolating affected systems, investigating the breach source, removing the attacker's access, restoring secure operations, and notifying affected customers according to regulations.
