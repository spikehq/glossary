## What Is Workflow Automation

Workflow Automation uses technology to perform sequences of incident management tasks automatically based on predefined rules. This can include logging incidents, notifying teams, or creating response tasks.

## Why Is Workflow Automation Important

Automation speeds up incident response by handling routine tasks quickly and consistently. It reduces manual errors, frees up responders for complex problem-solving, and helps lower resolution times (MTTR).

## Example Of Workflow Automation

An alert from a monitoring tool automatically triggers a workflow. The workflow creates an incident ticket, assigns it to the on-call engineer, posts details to a Slack channel, and escalates if not acknowledged within 10 minutes.

## Types Of Workflow Automation

- **Rule-Based:** Follows simple "if-then" logic (e.g., if priority is P1, notify leadership)
- **Script-Based:** Uses custom scripts for more complex automated actions
- **AI/ML-Driven:** Uses machine learning to predict issues or suggest actions based on past incidents
