## What Is Technical Debt

Technical debt in incident management refers to the accumulated consequences of taking shortcuts or delaying improvements in monitoring, alerting, and response systems. It represents the gap between current practices and optimal approaches, which eventually leads to increased incident frequency and resolution times.

## Why Understanding Technical Debt Important

Understanding and managing technical debt helps prevent degradation of incident response capabilities. Unaddressed technical debt increases the risk of outages, extends resolution times, and creates additional work for response teams. Recognizing this debt is the first step toward prioritizing improvements.

## Example Of Technical Debt

A team relies on manual processes to route incidents to the appropriate responders instead of implementing automated routing. This creates delays in response time and occasionally results in incidents being assigned to the wrong teams, extending resolution times and creating frustration.

## How to Implement Technical Debt Management

- Create a technical debt registry that documents known issues in incident management processes
- Categorize debt items by severity and potential impact on incident response
- Allocate regular time for addressing technical debt as part of sprint planning
- Track incident metrics to identify areas where technical debt is causing problems
- Review incident postmortems to identify process improvements that should be prioritized

## Best Practices

- Distinguish between planned technical debt (conscious trade-offs) and unplanned debt (oversights)
- Address technical debt that impacts critical incident response capabilities first
- Use incident management data like MTTA and MTTR to measure the impact of technical debt reduction efforts
