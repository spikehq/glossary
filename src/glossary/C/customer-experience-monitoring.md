## What Is Customer Experience Monitoring

Customer Experience Monitoring in incident management tracks how system issues affect users. It involves measuring service quality, user satisfaction, and the impact of incidents on customers' ability to use a product or service.

## Why Is Customer Experience Monitoring Important

It helps prioritize incidents based on user impact, improves response times for critical issues, and maintains customer satisfaction. By focusing on the customer perspective, organizations can align their incident management with business goals.

## Example Of Customer Experience Monitoring

An e-commerce platform uses real-time user feedback and transaction completion rates to detect a payment processing issue. This allows them to address the problem quickly before it affects a large number of customers.

## How To Implement Customer Experience Monitoring

- Set up user journey tracking and performance metrics

- Correlate technical incidents with customer impact data
- Train support teams to prioritize customer-impacting issues
