## What Is Configuration Item (CI)

A Configuration Item (CI) is any component that needs to be managed to deliver an IT service. CIs include hardware, software, documentation, personnel, and facilities that contribute to service delivery and require version control, protection, and tracking throughout their lifecycle.

## Why Is Configuration Item (CI) Important

Configuration Items form the foundation of effective incident management by providing visibility into system components and their relationships. They help teams quickly identify affected components during incidents, understand potential impacts, and implement appropriate fixes without causing unintended consequences.

## Example Of Configuration Item (CI)

During a network outage, the incident response team uses CI information to identify that a specific router (CI) is malfunctioning. The CI record shows all connected systems, recent changes, and the responsible team, allowing for faster diagnosis and targeted resolution.
