## What Is Centralized Incident Dashboard

A Centralized Incident Dashboard is a unified visual interface that displays real-time information about all ongoing incidents across an organization. It aggregates data from multiple monitoring systems, providing a single source of truth for incident status, severity, assigned responders, and resolution progress.

## Why Is Centralized Incident Dashboard Important

A centralized dashboard eliminates information silos by giving teams a shared view of all incidents. It speeds up response times, improves coordination between teams, and helps prioritize critical issues. Managers can quickly assess the overall health of systems and allocate resources more effectively.

## How To Build Centralized Incident Dashboard

- Identify all data sources that need to feed into the dashboard
- Select a platform that integrates with your existing monitoring tools
- Design layouts that highlight critical information at a glance
- Configure role-based views for different teams and stakeholders
- Set up automated alerts for dashboard status changes

## Best Practices

- Keep the most critical metrics visible without scrolling
- Use consistent color coding for incident severity levels
- Update dashboard data in real-time or at short intervals
