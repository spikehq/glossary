## What Is Collaborative Resolution

Collaborative resolution is an incident management approach where cross-functional teams work together to solve complex incidents. It involves real-time communication, shared visibility into incident details, and coordinated problem-solving across different expertise areas.

## Why Is Collaborative Resolution Important

Complex incidents often require diverse skills and knowledge that no single person possesses. Collaborative resolution speeds up incident handling by bringing together the right expertise at the right time. It also improves learning across teams and builds organizational resilience through shared experience.

## Example Of Collaborative Resolution

A critical application outage brings together developers, infrastructure engineers, security specialists, and product managers in a virtual war room. Each contributes their expertise—developers identify code issues, infrastructure teams address server problems, and product managers communicate with customers.
