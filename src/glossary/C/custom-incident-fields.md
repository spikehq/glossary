## What Are Custom Incident Fields

Custom incident fields are configurable data points that organizations add to their incident management system to capture information specific to their needs. These fields extend standard incident records with business-specific details, technical information, or tracking data.

## Why Are Custom Incident Fields Important

Standard incident fields often don't capture all the information organizations need for their unique environments. Custom fields allow teams to track industry-specific data, align with internal processes, and gather metrics that matter to their business. They also improve reporting capabilities and support more targeted incident analysis.

## Example Of Custom Incident Fields

A financial services company adds custom fields to track regulatory reporting requirements, affected financial instruments, and monetary impact of incidents. These fields help them meet compliance obligations and understand business consequences of technical issues.

## How To Create Custom Incident Fields

- Identify gaps in standard incident data that affect your analysis or reporting
- Design custom fields that capture specific information needed by your organization
- Configure your incident management system to include these custom fields
- Train teams on when and how to populate custom fields during incidents
- Review field usage periodically to ensure they provide value

## Best Practices

- Limit custom fields to information that drives decisions or provides meaningful insights
- Use structured field types (dropdowns, checkboxes) where possible to ensure data consistency
- Include custom fields in reports and dashboards to maximize their utility
