## What Is Customer Notification System

A customer notification system is a tool that automatically informs customers about incidents or outages affecting services they use. It provides timely, accurate information about the nature of the problem, its impact, and expected resolution time.

## Why Is Customer Notification System Important

Customer notification systems improve transparency and trust. They reduce support ticket volume by proactively informing customers about issues. This system also helps manage customer expectations during incidents, potentially mitigating negative impacts on satisfaction and retention.

## Example Of Customer Notification System

When a major e-commerce platform experiences a payment processing outage, the system automatically sends emails and updates the status page. It informs customers about the issue, its impact on orders, and the estimated time to resolution.
