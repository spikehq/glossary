## What Is Command and Control

Command and Control is a structured management approach used in incident response that establishes clear leadership roles and decision-making authority. It creates a hierarchical framework where designated leaders direct resources, coordinate team efforts, and make critical decisions during incidents.

## Why Is Command and Control Important

Command and Control prevents chaos during incidents by establishing clear leadership and communication channels. It eliminates confusion about who makes decisions, speeds up response times, and helps teams work together effectively under pressure. This structure is especially crucial during complex incidents involving multiple teams.

## Example Of Command and Control

During a major service outage, the Incident Commander takes charge, assigns specific roles to team members, and coordinates the response. They direct the network team to investigate connectivity issues while the database team checks for data corruption. Regular updates flow through the Commander, who makes final decisions on resolution steps.

## How To Implement Command and Control

- Define clear roles including Incident Commander, Communications Lead, and Technical Lead
- Create decision-making protocols for different incident severities
- Establish communication channels for incident updates and coordination
- Document the command structure in your incident response playbooks
- Practice the structure through regular incident drills

## Best Practices

- Rotate command roles regularly to build organizational resilience
- Keep command structures simple for faster decision-making
- Document all decisions and actions for post-incident review
