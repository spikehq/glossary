## What Are Cyber Physical Systems Incidents

Cyber Physical Systems Incidents are events that affect systems where digital and physical components interact. These incidents can impact both digital operations and physical infrastructure, potentially causing real-world consequences.

## Example of Cyber Physical Systems Incidents

A manufacturing plant experiences a cyberattack that alters the settings on robotic assembly lines. This not only disrupts digital systems but also causes physical damage to products and equipment.

## How to Implement Cyber Physical Systems Incident Management

- Develop incident response plans that address both cyber and physical aspects
- Create cross-functional teams with IT and operational technology expertise
- Implement monitoring systems that cover both digital and physical components
- Establish communication protocols between IT and physical security teams
- Conduct regular simulations of cyber-physical incidents

## Best Practices

- Maintain up-to-date inventories of all cyber-physical system components
- Implement segmentation between IT and operational technology networks
- Regularly assess and update security measures for both cyber and physical aspects
