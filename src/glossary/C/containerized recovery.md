## What Is Containerized Recovery

Containerized Recovery is an incident management approach that uses container technology to quickly restore services after an incident. It involves packaging applications and their dependencies into containers that can be rapidly deployed to replace failed systems.

## Why Is Containerized Recovery Important

Containerized Recovery dramatically reduces recovery time during incidents. Containers launch in seconds rather than minutes or hours needed for traditional servers. This approach provides consistent, predictable recovery regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

## Example of Containerized Recovery

When a database server fails, a financial services company automatically deploys a containerized version of the database with the latest backup. The container spins up in seconds, connects to the network, and begins serving requests while the team investigates the original failure.

## How to Implement Containerized Recovery

- Containerize critical applications and services
- Create automated recovery workflows using container orchestration
- Implement regular testing of container-based recovery
- Develop strategies for data persistence and state management
- Integrate container health checks with monitoring systems

## Best Practices

- Maintain immutable container images that are regularly updated and tested
- Use orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage container recovery
- Practice container-based recovery scenarios as part of disaster recovery testing
