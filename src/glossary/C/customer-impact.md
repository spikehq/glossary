## What Is Customer Impact In Incident Management

Customer impact in incident management refers to the effect an incident has on users or clients of a service. It measures how many customers are affected, the severity of disruption they experience, and how the incident influences their perception of service quality.

## Why Is Customer Impact Important In Incident Management

Understanding customer impact helps teams prioritize incidents effectively and allocate resources where they matter most. It provides context for business decisions during incident response and helps measure the true cost of incidents beyond technical metrics. Customer impact also informs communication strategies during and after incidents.

## Example Of Customer Impact In Incident Management

An e-commerce platform experiences a payment processing outage. The customer impact includes 15,000 users unable to complete purchases, an estimated $50,000 in lost sales, and increased support ticket volume. This information guides the incident priority and communication approach.

## How To Implement Customer Impact Assessment In Incident Management

- Define clear criteria for measuring customer impact across different services
- Create impact severity levels based on factors like number of affected users
- Integrate customer impact data into incident management dashboards
- Collect feedback from affected customers after major incidents
- Use impact metrics to prioritize incident response and resource allocation

## Best Practices

- Consider both quantitative measures (users affected) and qualitative factors (criticality of affected functions)
- Update customer impact assessments throughout an incident as conditions change
- Use historical customer impact data to identify and prioritize system improvements
