## What Is Collaborative Incident Response

Collaborative Incident Response is an approach where multiple teams work together to resolve incidents using shared tools, communication channels, and processes. It breaks down silos between departments to speed up incident resolution.

## Why Is Collaborative Incident Response Important

Incidents rarely affect just one team or system. Collaborative response brings together diverse expertise to solve complex problems faster. It improves communication, reduces finger-pointing, and creates shared ownership of both the problem and solution.

## Example of Collaborative Incident Response

During a major service outage, a company activates a virtual war room where engineering, customer support, and communications teams collaborate. Engineers fix the technical issue, support handles customer inquiries, and communications drafts updates for the status page—all coordinating in real-time.
