## What Is Critical Incident

A Critical Incident is a high-severity event that significantly impacts business operations, customer experience, or data security. These incidents typically involve service outages, data breaches, or system failures that require immediate attention and often activate emergency response procedures.

## Example of Critical Incident

An e-commerce platform experiences complete payment system failure during Black Friday sales. Customers cannot complete purchases, revenue is lost by the minute, and social media complaints are escalating. This triggers the highest severity incident response, pulling in executives and multiple technical teams.
