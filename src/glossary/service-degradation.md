## What Is Service Degradation

Service degradation occurs when a system continues to function but with reduced performance, reliability, or capabilities. Unlike a complete outage, degraded services operate below normal quality levels, creating a suboptimal user experience while still providing core functionality.

## Example of Service Degradation

An e-commerce website experiences slow page load times during a flash sale. The site remains accessible, but images load slowly, search functions time out occasionally, and checkout takes longer than normal. The degraded performance impacts sales but doesn't completely halt operations.
