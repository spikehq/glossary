## What Is Event Correlation

Event Correlation is the process of analyzing relationships between multiple events to identify patterns, causes, and effects. It helps teams connect seemingly isolated events into a coherent picture, revealing the underlying issues that may be causing incidents.

## Why Is Event Correlation Important

Event correlation reduces noise by grouping related alerts together. It helps identify the root cause when multiple systems generate events due to a single underlying problem. This speeds up diagnosis, reduces mean time to resolution, and prevents teams from chasing symptoms rather than causes.

## Example Of Event Correlation

A network switch failure triggers dozens of separate alerts from dependent systems. Event correlation tools recognize that all these alerts started within seconds of each other and share a network path. The system automatically creates a single incident ticket focused on the switch rather than the downstream effects.
