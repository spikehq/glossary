## What Is Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR)

Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) is the average time between when a system fails and when it returns to full functionality. This metric focuses specifically on the restoration period, measuring how quickly services can be brought back online after an outage.

## Why Is MTTR Important

MTTR directly impacts business continuity and user experience. Faster recovery means less downtime and fewer frustrated users. This metric helps organizations evaluate their disaster recovery capabilities and resilience strategies.

## Example Of MTTR

A database server crashes at 3:00 PM. After emergency response procedures, the database is back online at 3:45 PM. The MTTR is 45 minutes.

## How To Track MTTR

- Record precise failure and recovery timestamps for all incidents
- Calculate average recovery times across different systems
- Compare actual MTTR against recovery time objectives
- Identify systems with consistently high recovery times
- Test recovery procedures regularly to improve MTTR

## Best Practices

- Implement automated recovery procedures where possible
- Maintain up-to-date recovery playbooks for all critical systems
- Practice recovery scenarios through regular drills
