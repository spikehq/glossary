## What Is P2 (Priority Two)

P2 is a moderate priority level for incidents that cause limited service disruption or affect a smaller subset of users. These incidents require attention within hours rather than minutes but still need to be addressed promptly.

## Why Is P2 Important

P2 incidents can degrade user experience and potentially escalate if left unaddressed. They serve as early warnings of potential larger issues and provide opportunities to fix problems before they affect more users.

## Example Of P2

A feature that's unavailable for a specific user segment or a performance slowdown during non-peak hours would typically be classified as P2. These issues impact operations but don't prevent core business functions.
