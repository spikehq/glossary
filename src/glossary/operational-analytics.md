## What Is Operational Analytics

Operational analytics is the process of analyzing data from day-to-day operations to improve efficiency and effectiveness. In incident management, it involves examining incident data to identify patterns, trends, and areas for improvement.

## Why Is Operational Analytics Important

Operational analytics helps organizations understand their incident management performance over time. It enables teams to make data-driven decisions about resource allocation, process improvements, and strategic planning.

## Example of Operational Analytics

An IT support team uses operational analytics to analyze their incident tickets over the past year. They discover that 30% of incidents are related to password resets, leading them to implement a self-service password reset tool to reduce workload.

## How to Implement Operational Analytics

- Implement tools to collect and analyze incident data
- Create regular reports on key performance indicators
- Use data visualization to communicate insights effectively
- Incorporate findings into continuous improvement processes

## Best Practices
