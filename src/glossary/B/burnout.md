## What Is Burnout In Incident Management

Burnout in incident management is a state of chronic physical and emotional exhaustion experienced by responders due to prolonged stress, frequent high-pressure incidents, and interrupted work-life balance. It often leads to decreased performance, higher error rates, and staff turnover.

## Why Is Addressing Burnout Important In Incident Management

Addressing burnout is critical because exhausted incident responders make more mistakes and take longer to resolve issues. Teams with high burnout experience knowledge loss through turnover and decreased collaboration. Preventing burnout maintains your incident response capabilities and protects your most valuable asset—your people.

## Example Of Burnout In Incident Management

An on-call engineer receives alerts for five consecutive nights, losing significant sleep. During a major incident the following week, they miss critical warning signs and make configuration errors that extend the outage. The engineer later requests a transfer to a different team, citing unsustainable stress levels.

## How To Reduce Burnout With Spike

- Use Spike’s on-call scheduling to spread shifts fairly and avoid overloading anyone.
- Set up escalation policies so the same person is not always the one responding.
- Pause notifications during off-hours or breaks with Out of Office and Cooldown modes.
- Route lower-priority alerts to chat or email and save phone calls for urgent issues.
- Track incident trends to spot patterns and adjust workloads before burnout happens.
