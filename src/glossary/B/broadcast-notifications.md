## What Are Broadcast Notifications

Broadcast Notifications are emergency communications sent simultaneously to multiple recipients across various channels during critical incidents. They deliver important incident information to stakeholders, affected teams, and leadership through multiple methods like email, SMS, push notifications, and collaboration tools.

## Why Are Broadcast Notifications Important

Broadcast Notifications speed up incident response by alerting all necessary personnel at once. They reduce the communication burden on incident commanders and help maintain consistent messaging across teams. During major incidents, they keep stakeholders informed without disrupting the resolution process.

## Example Of Broadcast Notifications

When a critical payment system fails, a broadcast notification is sent to the engineering team, customer support, executive leadership, and the communications team. Each group receives the same core information through their preferred channels, creating immediate awareness across the organization.

## How To Implement Broadcast Notifications

- Define recipient groups and their preferred notification channels
- Create message templates for different incident types and severities
- Configure escalation paths for unanswered broadcasts
- Set up delivery tracking to confirm receipt of critical messages
- Establish protocols for when broadcasts should be used

## Best Practices

- Keep broadcast messages clear, concise, and actionable
- Include severity level, impact, and next steps in every broadcast
- Test broadcast systems regularly to verify delivery across all channels
