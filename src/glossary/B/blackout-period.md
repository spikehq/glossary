## What Is Blackout Period In Incident Management

A Blackout Period is a predetermined timeframe during which system changes, updates, or maintenance activities are prohibited. In incident management, these periods protect critical business operations during high-traffic or sensitive times.

## Why Is Blackout Period Important In Incident Management

Blackout Periods minimize the risk of incidents during business-critical times. They prevent potentially disruptive changes when system stability is paramount, such as during holiday shopping seasons, financial reporting periods, or major events.

## Example of Blackout Period In Incident Management

An e-commerce company implements a blackout period from November 20 to January 5, prohibiting all non-emergency code deployments and system changes to maintain stability during the peak holiday shopping season.

## How to Implement Blackout Period In Incident Management

- Identify critical business periods that require maximum system stability
- Create a blackout calendar and share it with all technical teams
- Develop an exception process for emergency changes
- Communicate blackout rules clearly to all stakeholders
- Implement technical controls to prevent unauthorized changes

## Best Practices

- Plan major updates and changes well before blackout periods begin
- Create clear emergency override procedures for critical fixes
- Review and adjust blackout periods annually based on business needs
