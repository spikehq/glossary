## What Is Backup In Incident Management

A Backup in incident management refers to both data backup systems and backup personnel. Data backups are copies of critical information stored separately from primary systems, while personnel backups are designated individuals who can step in when primary responders are unavailable.

## Why Is Backup Important In Incident Management

Backups provide resilience during incidents. Data backups enable recovery from data loss or corruption, while personnel backups prevent response delays when primary responders are unavailable or overwhelmed. Both types of backups reduce incident impact and recovery time.

## Example of Backup In Incident Management

During a ransomware attack, a company's primary systems become encrypted and inaccessible. The incident response team quickly restores operations using last night's data backup, while the backup incident commander steps in when the primary commander reaches their work-hour limit.

## How to Implement Backup In Incident Management

- Create automated, regular data backup processes with verification
- Designate and train backup personnel for key incident response roles
- Document backup procedures in accessible runbooks
- Test backup recovery processes regularly
- Store backups securely and separately from primary systems

## Best Practices

- Follow the 3-2-1 rule: three copies, two different media types, one off-site
- Rotate on-call responsibilities to build broad incident response expertise
- Test backup recovery processes under realistic conditions
