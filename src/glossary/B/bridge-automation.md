## What Is Bridge Automation

Bridge Automation refers to the technology that automatically creates and manages communication channels (like conference calls or chat rooms) when incidents occur. It brings together the right people and resources without manual intervention.

## Why Is Bridge Automation Important

Bridge Automation speeds up incident response by eliminating the time-consuming process of manually setting up communication channels. It reduces coordination overhead, enables faster collaboration, and creates a consistent environment for every incident.

## Example Of Bridge Automation

When a payment processing system fails, the incident management platform automatically creates a Slack channel, starts a Zoom conference call, and invites the relevant team members based on the incident type. It also pulls in relevant documentation and previous similar incidents.

## How To Implement Bridge Automation

- Integrate your incident management tool with communication platforms
- Create templates for different incident types with predefined participants
- Set up automatic documentation and recording of bridge sessions
- Configure triggers based on incident severity or category
- Test the automation regularly with simulated incidents

## Best Practices

- Include clear roles and responsibilities in bridge templates
- Automatically bring relevant documentation and runbooks into the bridge
- Keep bridges focused by only inviting essential personnel initially, with options to add others as needed
