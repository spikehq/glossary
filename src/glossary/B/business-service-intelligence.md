## What Is Business Service Intelligence

Business service intelligence is the practice of mapping incidents to business services and analyzing their impact on organizational objectives. It connects technical incidents with business outcomes to prioritize response efforts based on business value rather than technical severity alone.

## Why Is Business Service Intelligence Important

Business service intelligence bridges the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. It helps organizations make informed decisions about incident priority, resource allocation, and service improvement investments based on actual business impact rather than technical metrics alone.

## Example Of Business Service Intelligence

A minor database slowdown might typically receive low priority, but business service intelligence reveals it affects the checkout process during a major promotion. This insight elevates its priority and mobilizes additional resources for faster resolution.

## How To Implement Business Service Intelligence

- Create a service dependency map linking technical components to business services
- Assign business impact values to different services based on revenue, customer experience, or strategic importance
- Integrate business context into incident management workflows
- Develop dashboards showing real-time business impact during incidents
- Incorporate business impact metrics into post-incident reviews

## Best Practices

- Involve business stakeholders in defining service importance and impact thresholds
- Update service mappings regularly as applications and infrastructure evolve
- Use historical business impact data to improve future incident prioritization decisions
