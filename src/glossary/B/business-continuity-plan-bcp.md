## What Is Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a documented strategy that outlines how an organization will continue operating during unplanned disruptions in service. It includes procedures for maintaining critical business functions during emergencies, disasters, or major incidents, and provides a roadmap for recovery to normal operations.

## Why Is Business Continuity Plan (BCP) Important

A BCP protects your organization from extended downtime and financial losses during major incidents. It helps maintain customer trust by minimizing service disruptions and provides clear guidance for staff during high-stress situations. Without a BCP, organizations risk prolonged recovery times and potential business failure after significant incidents.

## Example Of Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

A cloud service provider's BCP includes procedures for switching to backup data centers if their primary facility experiences an outage. The plan details communication protocols, staff responsibilities, and recovery time objectives for each critical service. It also outlines steps for returning to normal operations once the incident is resolved.

## How To Create Business Continuity Plan (BCP)

- Conduct a business impact analysis to identify critical functions
- Develop recovery strategies for different incident scenarios
- Document procedures for emergency response and recovery
- Train staff on their roles during disruptions
- Test the plan regularly through simulations and drills

## Best Practices

- Keep your BCP documentation accessible to all stakeholders during emergencies
- Update your plan after major incidents or significant changes to your infrastructure
- Include communication templates and contact lists for quick deployment during incidents
