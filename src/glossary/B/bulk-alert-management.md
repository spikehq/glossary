## What Is Bulk Alert Management

Bulk Alert Management is a capability that allows incident teams to handle multiple related alerts simultaneously. It enables users to apply actions, status changes, or assignments to groups of alerts at once, streamlining incident response workflows.

## Why Is Bulk Alert Management Important

Bulk Alert Management reduces the time spent on repetitive tasks during major incidents. It prevents alert fatigue by allowing responders to quickly organize and prioritize multiple notifications, especially when a single incident triggers numerous alerts across different systems.

## Example Of Bulk Alert Management

During a network outage, 25 alerts fire from different systems. Instead of addressing each individually, the on-call engineer uses bulk management to acknowledge all related alerts, assign them to the networking team, and set their status to "investigating" in one operation.
