## What Is Bot-Assisted Triage

Bot-assisted triage is an incident management approach that uses automated bots to perform initial assessment and categorization of incoming incidents. These bots leverage predefined rules, machine learning algorithms, or AI to analyze incident data, determine severity, and route issues to appropriate teams without human intervention.

## Why Is Bot-Assisted Triage Important

Bot-assisted triage reduces response time by immediately processing incoming incidents. It minimizes human error in initial assessments and frees up skilled engineers from repetitive triage tasks. This approach enables consistent application of triage protocols even during high-volume incident periods.

## Example Of Bot-Assisted Triage

When a server monitoring alert triggers, a triage bot automatically analyzes the alert details, checks historical data for similar incidents, and assigns it to the database team with "high priority" based on the affected customer count and service impact level.

## How To Implement Bot-Assisted Triage

- Select a bot platform that integrates with your incident management tools
- Define clear triage rules and decision trees for common incident types
- Start with simple, high-confidence scenarios before expanding to complex cases
- Implement feedback mechanisms for continuous improvement
- Maintain human oversight for unusual or critical incidents

## Best Practices

- Program bots to escalate ambiguous cases to human responders rather than making uncertain decisions
- Regularly update triage rules based on post-incident reviews and changing infrastructure
- Create transparency by documenting how the bot makes triage decisions
