## What Is Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

Business Impact Analysis is a systematic process that identifies and evaluates the potential effects of an interruption to critical business operations. In incident management, BIA helps prioritize systems and processes based on their importance to the organization.

## Why Is Business Impact Analysis Important

BIA provides crucial information for incident response and disaster recovery planning. It helps organizations understand which systems and processes are most critical, allowing them to allocate resources effectively during incidents and minimize business disruption.

## Example Of Business Impact Analysis

A financial services company conducts a BIA and discovers that a 30-minute outage of their trading platform could result in millions of dollars in losses. This insight leads them to implement more robust redundancy and faster incident response for this system.

## How To Conduct Business Impact Analysis

- Identify key business processes and systems
- Determine the impact of disruptions over time
- Assess interdependencies between systems
- Calculate potential financial and operational losses
- Prioritize recovery strategies based on findings

## Best Practices

- Involve stakeholders from various departments in the BIA process
- Regularly update the BIA to reflect changes in the business
- Use BIA results to inform incident response and recovery plans
