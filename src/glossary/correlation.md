## What Is Correlation

Correlation in incident management is the process of identifying relationships between multiple alerts, events, or incidents to determine if they share a common cause or are related in some way. It helps teams see the bigger picture rather than treating each alert as an isolated issue.

## Why Is Correlation Important

Correlation reduces alert noise and helps teams focus on root causes rather than symptoms. It prevents duplicate work, speeds up incident resolution, and provides context for troubleshooting. Without correlation, teams often waste time addressing individual alerts while missing the underlying problem.

## Example Of Correlation

A website experiences slow response times, generating alerts from the application server, database, and load balancer. Through correlation, the incident team identifies that all issues started after a recent code deployment, allowing them to quickly rollback the change rather than investigating each alert separately.
