## What Is Hybrid Incident Escalation

Hybrid Incident Escalation is an approach that combines automated and manual escalation processes to route incidents to the appropriate responders. It uses technology to handle routine escalations while allowing human judgment for complex situations that require expertise or special handling.

## Why Is Hybrid Incident Escalation Important

Hybrid Incident Escalation balances speed with accuracy in incident response. It reduces alert fatigue by automating predictable escalation paths while preserving human decision-making for nuanced situations where context matters. This approach improves both efficiency and effectiveness.

## Example Of Hybrid Incident Escalation

When a server reaches 90% CPU utilization, the system automatically alerts the infrastructure team. If the issue persists for 15 minutes, a human incident manager evaluates the situation and decides whether to escalate to senior engineers or the database team based on the specific workload patterns.

## How To Implement Hybrid Incident Escalation

- Define clear criteria for automated versus manual escalation decisions
- Create escalation policies with appropriate time thresholds
- Establish roles for human escalation managers with decision authority
- Build feedback loops to improve automated routing over time
- Implement communication channels for both automated and human-driven escalations

## Best Practices

- Document the reasoning behind manual escalation decisions to improve future automation
- Train escalation managers on both technical and communication aspects of their role
- Review escalation effectiveness regularly and adjust thresholds based on outcomes
