## What Is Hotfix

A hotfix is an urgent software update applied directly to production systems to address critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, or functionality issues. Unlike regular updates, hotfixes bypass standard testing cycles due to the immediate need to resolve serious problems.

## Why Is Hotfix Important

Hotfixes provide a rapid response mechanism for addressing critical issues that cannot wait for regular release cycles. They help incident management teams quickly restore service, patch security vulnerabilities, and fix functionality problems that impact users.

## Example Of Hotfix

During routine monitoring, an incident team discovers a security vulnerability in their authentication system. Rather than waiting for the next scheduled release, they develop and deploy a hotfix within hours to patch the vulnerability before it can be exploited.

## How To Implement Hotfix

- Create a streamlined approval process for emergency code changes
- Develop minimal testing protocols that balance speed with safety
- Establish clear documentation requirements for hotfix changes
- Build deployment mechanisms that can quickly push updates to production
- Define rollback procedures in case the hotfix causes unexpected problems

## Best Practices

- Document all hotfixes thoroughly for future reference and inclusion in regular release cycles
- Limit hotfix scope to only what's necessary to address the immediate issue
- Conduct a brief post-deployment verification to confirm the hotfix resolved the problem
