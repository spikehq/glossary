## What Is Human Error

Human error in incident management refers to mistakes, oversights, or poor decisions made by individuals that lead to or exacerbate incidents. These can range from simple typos to complex misjudgments in critical situations.

## Why Is Understanding Human Error Important

Recognizing the role of human error helps organizations develop more effective incident prevention and response strategies. It shifts focus from blame to systemic improvements, fostering a culture of learning and continuous improvement.

## Example of Human Error

A system administrator accidentally deletes a critical database during routine maintenance, causing a major service outage. This incident highlights the need for better safeguards and verification processes.
