## What Is Hazard Mitigation

Hazard mitigation in incident management is the process of identifying potential risks and taking proactive steps to reduce their impact or likelihood. It involves analyzing past incidents, assessing current vulnerabilities, and implementing preventive measures to minimize future threats.

## Why Is Hazard Mitigation Important

Hazard mitigation helps organizations reduce the frequency and severity of incidents. By addressing potential problems before they occur, companies can save time, resources, and reputation. It also improves overall system reliability and resilience.

## Example of Hazard Mitigation

A tech company identifies that power outages often lead to service disruptions. They implement backup power systems and distribute their servers across multiple locations to mitigate this hazard.

## How to Mitigate Hazards

- Conduct a thorough risk assessment
- Prioritize identified hazards based on impact and likelihood
- Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority hazards
- Implement chosen mitigation measures
- Monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation efforts
