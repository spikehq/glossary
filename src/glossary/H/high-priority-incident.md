## What Is High Priority Incident

A High Priority Incident is an event that severely impacts business operations, affects numerous users, or threatens data security. These incidents require immediate attention, dedicated resources, and often involve escalation to senior technical staff or management.

## Why Identifying High Priority Incident Important

Properly identifying and handling high priority incidents ensures that critical issues receive appropriate resources and attention. This prioritization helps organizations minimize damage, reduce downtime, and maintain customer trust during serious disruptions.

## Example Of High Priority Incident

An e-commerce platform experiences a database failure during a major sales event, preventing customers from completing purchases. The incident team immediately classifies this as high priority, activates the incident command structure, and mobilizes database specialists to restore functionality.
