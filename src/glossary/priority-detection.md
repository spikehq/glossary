## What Is Priority Detection

Priority detection is the process of automatically assessing and assigning priority levels to incidents based on predefined criteria and real-time data. It uses monitoring systems, alert data, and business context to determine how urgent and important an incident is without manual intervention.

## Why Is Priority Detection Important

Automated priority detection speeds up incident response. It reduces the cognitive load on responders during triage, creates consistency in prioritization, and helps teams focus immediately on the most critical issues. This automation becomes essential as organizations scale their operations and monitoring systems.

## Example Of Priority Detection

An e-commerce platform's monitoring system detects a payment service disruption during Black Friday sales. Based on the affected service, time of day, number of error responses, and revenue impact, the system automatically assigns it P1 priority and triggers immediate notification to senior engineers.

## How To Do Priority Detection

- Define clear criteria for each priority level
- Configure monitoring tools to collect relevant impact data
- Create rules that map alert conditions to priority levels
- Implement machine learning to improve detection accuracy
- Set up automatic escalation paths based on detected priority

## Best Practices

- Include business context (like time of day or revenue impact) in detection rules
- Start with simple rules and gradually increase complexity
- Regularly review and tune detection accuracy based on real incidents
