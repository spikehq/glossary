## What Is Incident Prioritization

Incident Prioritization is the process of assessing and ranking incidents based on their urgency and impact on business operations. It helps teams focus on the most critical issues first and allocate resources effectively.

## Why Is Incident Prioritization Important

Proper incident prioritization ensures that high-impact incidents receive immediate attention. It helps organizations manage multiple incidents efficiently, reduce overall downtime, and maintain service level agreements.

## Example of Incident Prioritization

A company prioritizes a database failure affecting all customers as a high-priority incident, while a minor UI bug is classified as low priority.
