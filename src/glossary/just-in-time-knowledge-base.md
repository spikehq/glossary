## What Is Just-in-time Knowledge Base

A Just-in-time Knowledge Base provides relevant information or documentation to responders exactly when and where it's needed during an incident. Instead of manual searching, context-aware information is surfaced automatically within the workflow.

## Why Is Just-in-time Knowledge Base Important

It speeds up troubleshooting and resolution by reducing search time. Providing accurate, relevant information quickly helps responders make better decisions and follow correct procedures, especially under pressure.

## Example Of Just-in-time Knowledge Base

An alert for a database error appears in an incident management tool. The system automatically links or displays the standard operating procedure (SOP) for handling that specific database error code.

## How To Create Just-in-time Knowledge Base

- Integrate your knowledge base with monitoring and incident tools
- Use tagging and metadata to link articles to specific alerts or CIs
- Develop rules or use AI to determine which information is relevant based on incident context
- Embed knowledge snippets or links directly into incident tickets or chat interfaces

## Best Practices

- Keep knowledge base articles concise and action-oriented
- Regularly review and update knowledge content for accuracy
- Gather feedback from responders on the usefulness of surfaced information

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Surfacing outdated or incorrect information
- Overwhelming responders with too much irrelevant information
- Poor integration leading to slow or inaccurate delivery
