## What Is Asset Management

Asset management is the systematic process of deploying, operating, maintaining, and disposing of the resources that support incident response. It involves tracking hardware, software, and service components throughout their lifecycle and understanding their relationships.

## Why Is Asset Management Important

Effective asset management provides the foundation for incident detection and response. It helps teams quickly identify affected components during an incident, understand potential impacts, and determine the right responders. Good asset management reduces mean time to resolution.

## Example Of Asset Management

When a server failure alert triggers, an asset management system immediately shows that this server hosts three critical applications, their owners, and their dependencies, allowing the incident manager to notify the right teams quickly.

## How To Implement Asset Management

- Build a centralized asset inventory with automated discovery tools
- Establish processes for updating the inventory when changes occur
- Implement a configuration management database (CMDB)
- Tag assets with business criticality and ownership information
- Integrate asset data with incident management workflows

## Best Practices

- Automate asset discovery and updates where possible
- Focus on relationships between assets, not just the assets themselves
- Keep business impact information current for all critical assets
