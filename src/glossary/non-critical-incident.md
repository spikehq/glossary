## What Is Non-Critical Incident

A non-critical incident is an event that disrupts normal business operations but doesn't significantly impact core services or large numbers of users. These incidents have minimal urgency and typically allow for standard resolution timeframes without requiring immediate attention or emergency response procedures.

## Example Of Non-Critical Incident

A printer malfunction affecting a single department would be classified as non-critical. While it impacts productivity for some users, the business can continue operating normally while the issue is resolved through standard support channels.
