## What Is Preventive Action In Incident Management

Preventive Action is a proactive measure taken to eliminate the cause of a potential incident before it occurs. It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities and addressing them to prevent future problems rather than reacting to incidents after they happen.

## Why Is Preventive Action Important

Preventive Action reduces the likelihood of incidents occurring in the first place. It saves time, resources, and reputation damage by addressing issues before they impact services. Proactive prevention is typically less costly than reactive incident response.

## Example Of Preventive Action

After noticing that server overloads frequently occur during peak traffic periods, a team implements automatic scaling rules that add server capacity when load reaches 70% rather than waiting for failures at 95% capacity.

## How To Implement Preventive Action

- Analyze past incidents to identify recurring patterns
- Conduct regular risk assessments to spot potential vulnerabilities
- Implement monitoring systems that detect early warning signs
- Create and test contingency plans for high-risk scenarios
- Establish regular maintenance schedules for critical systems

## Best Practices

- Prioritize preventive actions based on risk level and potential impact
- Document all preventive measures and their effectiveness
- Review and update preventive strategies regularly as systems and threats evolve
