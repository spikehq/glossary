## What Is Platform Integration

Platform Integration in incident management refers to connecting your incident response tools with other systems like monitoring, ticketing, communication, and development platforms. This creates a unified workflow across the incident lifecycle.

## Why Is Platform Integration Important

Platform Integration eliminates manual data transfer between systems. It speeds up incident response by automating workflows, reduces context switching for responders, and creates a more complete view of incidents across different tools.

## Example Of Platform Integration

An incident management system integrates with Slack, PagerDuty, and Jira. When an alert triggers, it automatically creates a Slack channel, notifies on-call staff through PagerDuty, and generates a Jira ticketâ€”all without manual intervention.
