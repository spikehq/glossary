## What Is Priority Automation

Priority Automation is a feature in incident management systems that automatically assigns priority levels to incidents based on predefined rules and criteria. It evaluates factors like service impact, affected users, and business criticality to determine how urgently an incident needs attention.

## Why Is Priority Automation Important

Priority Automation eliminates subjective decision-making during incident triage. It speeds up response times by instantly categorizing incidents, helps teams focus on what matters most, and creates consistency in how incidents are handled across the organization.

## Example Of Priority Automation

When a database server goes down, the incident management system automatically assigns it P1 (highest priority) because it affects customer data access. Meanwhile, a minor UI bug gets assigned P3 because it has minimal impact on users.

## How To Implement Priority Automation

- Define clear priority levels and criteria for each level
- Create rules based on impact, urgency, and affected services
- Test your automation rules with historical incidents
- Train teams on the new automated priority system
- Review and refine rules based on feedback

## Best Practices

- Keep priority levels simple (3-5 levels work best)
- Include business impact as a key factor in priority determination
- Review automation rules quarterly to keep them aligned with business needs
