## What Is P3 (Priority Three)

P3 is a low-priority incident level that represents minor issues with limited impact on users or business operations. These incidents may cause slight inconvenience but don't significantly affect core functionality or user experience.

## Why Is P3 Important

P3 incidents help teams identify and fix minor issues before they potentially grow into larger problems. They also provide valuable data about system behavior and can reveal opportunities for improvement in less critical areas.

## Example Of P3

A cosmetic UI issue, a minor delay in non-critical report generation, or a feature that's working but not optimally would be classified as P3. These issues are noticeable but don't prevent users from accomplishing their tasks.
