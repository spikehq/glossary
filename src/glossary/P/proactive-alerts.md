## What Are Proactive Alerts

Proactive Alerts are notifications generated by monitoring systems before an incident occurs or reaches critical status. They identify potential issues based on early warning signs, threshold violations, or anomalous patterns in system behavior.

## Why Are Proactive Alerts Important

Proactive Alerts help teams address issues before they impact users or services. They reduce downtime by catching problems early, lower the stress of emergency responses, and shift the focus from firefighting to prevention.

## Example Of Proactive Alerts

A monitoring system detects that disk space is reaching 80% capacity on a critical server. It sends a proactive alert to the operations team, who can add storage capacity before the disk fills completely and causes service disruption.

## How To Implement Proactive Alerts

- Identify key metrics and thresholds that indicate potential problems
- Configure monitoring tools to detect anomalies and trends
- Set up appropriate notification channels for different alert types
- Create escalation paths for alerts that aren't addressed
- Regularly review and tune alert thresholds

## Best Practices

- Set meaningful thresholds based on historical performance data
- Use different notification channels based on alert severity
- Implement progressive alerting with multiple thresholds
