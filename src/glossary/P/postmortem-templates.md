## What Are Postmortem Templates

Postmortem Templates are standardized documents or forms used to analyze incidents after they've been resolved. They guide teams through a structured review process to document what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## Why Are Postmortem Templates Important

Postmortem Templates create consistency in incident reviews across teams and incidents. They save time during the analysis process, help capture all relevant information, and make it easier to track action items and improvements over time.

## Example Of Postmortem Template

A cloud service provider uses a template that includes sections for incident timeline, root cause analysis, customer impact assessment, and action items. This template is filled out after every major outage and shared with all engineering teams.

## How To Create Postmortem Templates

- Create a basic template with key sections for incident analysis
- Include fields for timeline, impact, root cause, and action items
- Make the template accessible to all relevant teams
- Review and update the template based on team feedback
- Store completed postmortems in a searchable repository
