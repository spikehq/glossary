## What Is Process Automation

Process automation in incident management involves using technology to automatically execute routine response tasks without human intervention. It includes alert routing, incident creation, stakeholder notifications, data collection, and even remediation of known issues.

## Why Is Process Automation Important

Process automation speeds up incident response by eliminating manual steps and reducing human error. It frees up responders to focus on complex problem-solving rather than repetitive tasks, while providing consistent execution of response procedures.

## Example Of Process Automation

When a database server exceeds 90% memory usage, an automated workflow creates an incident ticket, pages the database team, collects diagnostic logs, restarts non-critical services, and posts status updates to affected teamsâ€”all before a human responder even acknowledges the alert.

## How To Implement Process Automation

- Identify repetitive, rule-based tasks in your incident response process
- Start with simple automations like alert routing and notification
- Document decision trees for common incidents
- Implement automation tools that integrate with your existing systems
- Gradually add complexity as you build confidence

## Best Practices

- Include manual override options for all automated processes
- Test automations thoroughly in non-production environments
- Monitor and measure the effectiveness of your automations
