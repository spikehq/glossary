## What Are Phone Call Notifications

Phone Call Notifications are automated voice calls sent to on-call responders when critical incidents occur. They typically include information about the incident and may require acknowledgment from the recipient.

## Why Are Phone Call Notifications Important

Phone Call Notifications break through notification fatigue when urgent action is needed. They're more likely to wake sleeping team members during off-hours incidents and provide a reliable backup when other notification methods fail.

## Example Of Phone Call Notifications

When a payment processing system fails at 2 AM, the incident management platform automatically calls the on-call engineer. The call includes a brief description of the incident and options to acknowledge or escalate the issue.
