## What Is Predictable Pricing

Predictable pricing is a transparent billing model for incident management tools where costs remain consistent and foreseeable regardless of usage fluctuations. It typically involves fixed monthly or annual fees with clear limits on features, users, or alerts, allowing organizations to budget accurately without fear of unexpected charges.

## Why Is Predictable Pricing Important

Predictable pricing helps organizations plan their incident management budgets with confidence. It eliminates surprise charges during major incidents when alert volumes spike. Teams can focus on resolving issues rather than worrying about mounting costs during critical situations.

## Example Of Predictable Pricing

A company pays $500 monthly for their incident management platform regardless of whether they handle 10 or 1,000 incidents. During a major outage, they receive hundreds of alerts but face no additional charges, unlike competitors using per-alert pricing models.
