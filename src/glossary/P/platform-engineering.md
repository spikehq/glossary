## What Is Platform Engineering

Platform engineering is the discipline of designing and building internal developer platforms that enable software delivery and operations teams to self-service their infrastructure needs. In incident management, it focuses on creating standardized, reliable systems that minimize incidents and streamline response.

## Why Is Platform Engineering Important

Platform engineering reduces incident frequency by standardizing infrastructure and eliminating error-prone manual processes. It accelerates incident response by providing consistent tooling and environments, while improving visibility across complex systems.

## Example Of Platform Engineering

A retail company's platform team builds a self-service portal where development teams can provision pre-hardened, security-compliant environments. This reduces configuration errors that previously caused 40% of production incidents.
