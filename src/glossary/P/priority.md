## What Is Priority

Priority in incident management is the assigned level of urgency and importance given to an incident based on its impact on business operations and customers. It determines the order in which incidents are addressed and the resources allocated to their resolution.

## Example Of Priority

A payment processing system failure affecting thousands of customers receives P1 (highest) priority, triggering immediate response from senior engineers. Meanwhile, a minor UI glitch affecting a few internal users is assigned P4 priority for later resolution.
