## What Is Visibility

Visibility in incident management refers to the ability to detect, monitor, and understand what's happening across your IT environment. It provides a comprehensive view of systems, networks, and applications, allowing teams to quickly identify and respond to incidents.

## Why Is Visibility Important

Effective visibility enables teams to detect security incidents quickly and accurately. It helps incident responders understand the scope and impact of an incident, make informed decisions about how to respond, and prioritize their actions. Without proper visibility, incidents may go undetected or be misunderstood.

## Example Of Visibility

A company implements a centralized logging system that collects data from all servers, network devices, and applications. When unusual activity is detected, security analysts can quickly view relevant logs from multiple systems in one place, helping them determine if the activity represents a genuine security incident.

## How To Implement Visibility

- Deploy monitoring tools across your environment to collect data
- Implement centralized logging to aggregate information from multiple sources
- Create dashboards that display key metrics and status information
- Establish alerting thresholds for abnormal conditions
- Develop processes for sharing information between teams

## Best Practices

- Aim for comprehensive coverage across your entire IT environment
- Balance the level of detail with usability to avoid information overload
- Regularly review and update your visibility tools and processes as your environment changes
