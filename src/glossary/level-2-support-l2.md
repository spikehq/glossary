## What is Level 2 Support (L2)

Level 2 Support (L2) is the second tier of technical support that handles more complex incidents escalated from L1. L2 technicians possess deeper technical knowledge and specialized skills to troubleshoot difficult problems that couldn't be resolved at the first level of support.

## Why is Level 2 Support (L2) Important

L2 support prevents bottlenecks at higher support levels by resolving moderately complex issues. It bridges the gap between basic troubleshooting and advanced technical solutions. Effective L2 support reduces resolution times for complicated incidents and maintains service quality during challenging situations.

## Example of Level 2 Support (L2)

An L1 agent escalates an incident where multiple users experience intermittent network connectivity. The L2 technician analyzes network logs, identifies a malfunctioning router, and implements a temporary routing change to restore service while a permanent fix is developed.

## How to Implement Level 2 Support (L2)

- Hire technicians with specialized knowledge in relevant systems
- Create clear handoff procedures between L1 and L2 teams
- Develop detailed documentation for complex troubleshooting
- Implement collaboration tools for knowledge sharing
- Establish service level agreements for escalated tickets

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular knowledge transfer sessions between L2 and L3 teams
- Maintain detailed records of complex resolutions for future reference
- Involve L2 technicians in post-incident reviews to improve processes
