## What Is Observability Integration

Observability integration is the process of connecting various monitoring tools, logs, metrics, and tracing systems into a unified framework. It creates a comprehensive view of system behavior by correlating data from different sources, making it easier to understand complex system states and troubleshoot issues.

## Why Is Observability Integration Important

Observability integration provides a complete picture of system health by connecting data from multiple sources. It speeds up troubleshooting by eliminating the need to switch between different tools and helps teams understand relationships between components. This holistic view is crucial for managing modern, complex IT environments.

## Example Of Observability Integration

A microservices application experiences intermittent performance issues. Through their integrated observability platform, engineers can trace a slow customer transaction across multiple services, view the corresponding infrastructure metrics, and examine logs from each componentâ€”all in a single interface. This integration helps them quickly identify a memory leak in a specific service.
