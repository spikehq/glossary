## What Is Dashboard Customization

Dashboard customization is the process of tailoring incident management displays to show relevant metrics, alerts, and statuses based on specific team needs and roles. It allows organizations to create focused views that highlight the most important information for different stakeholders.

## Why Is Dashboard Customization Important

Customized dashboards help teams quickly identify and respond to incidents by displaying only the most relevant information. They improve situational awareness, reduce cognitive overload, and allow different teams to focus on metrics that matter most to their specific responsibilities.

## Example Of Dashboard Customization

A DevOps team creates role-specific dashboards: one for on-call engineers showing active incidents and their status, another for managers displaying incident trends and SLA compliance, and a third for executives summarizing business impact and resolution progress.

## How To Customize Dashboard

- Identify key metrics and information needs for different user roles
- Select a dashboard platform that supports flexible layouts and data sources
- Create templates for common use cases like incident response or trend analysis
- Allow users to save personal views while maintaining standardized team dashboards
- Gather feedback and iterate on dashboard designs

## Best Practices

- Keep dashboards simple and focused on actionable information
- Use consistent color coding and visual indicators across all dashboards
- Include both real-time operational metrics and longer-term trend data
