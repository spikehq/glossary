## What Is Distributed Incident Management

Distributed Incident Management is an approach where incident response responsibilities are spread across multiple teams, locations, or time zones. It enables organizations to respond to incidents 24/7 without relying on a single centralized team.

## Why Is Distributed Incident Management Important

Distributed incident management reduces response times by leveraging globally distributed teams. It prevents responder burnout by spreading on-call responsibilities across more people and time zones. This approach also builds organizational resilience through diverse expertise and perspectives during incident resolution.

## Example Of Distributed Incident Management

A SaaS company with offices in San Francisco, London, and Singapore implements a "follow-the-sun" incident management model. When a critical database issue occurs, the team in Singapore handles initial triage, London manages ongoing remediation, and San Francisco completes resolution and postmortem analysis.

## How To Implement Distributed Incident Management

- Create clear handoff procedures between distributed teams
- Implement shared incident documentation accessible to all response teams
- Establish consistent incident classification and response protocols
- Deploy communication tools that work effectively across time zones
- Define escalation paths that account for distributed expertise

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular joint incident response exercises across distributed teams
- Maintain a centralized knowledge base accessible to all incident responders
- Document incidents thoroughly to support seamless handoffs between teams
