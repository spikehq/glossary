## What Are Dynamic Thresholds

Dynamic thresholds are adaptive alert boundaries that automatically adjust based on historical patterns, time of day, or other contextual factors. Unlike static thresholds, they evolve with changing system behaviors to reduce false alarms while still catching genuine anomalies.

## Why Are Dynamic Thresholds Important

Dynamic thresholds significantly reduce alert fatigue by adapting to normal variations in system behavior. They help teams focus on genuine issues rather than expected fluctuations, improving incident detection accuracy and response efficiency while accommodating seasonal patterns or growth.

## Example Of Dynamic Thresholds

An e-commerce platform typically handles 1,000 transactions per hour on weekdays but 5,000 per hour during weekends. Dynamic thresholds automatically adjust alert sensitivity based on these patterns, triggering alerts only when traffic falls outside the expected range for that specific day and time.

## How To Implement Dynamic Thresholds

- Collect baseline performance data across different time periods
- Use machine learning algorithms to identify normal patterns and variations
- Configure alerting tools to apply different thresholds based on time, day, or season
- Start with a learning period where thresholds adapt without triggering alerts
- Gradually refine threshold sensitivity based on feedback from incident responders

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and validate threshold effectiveness to prevent missed incidents
- Combine dynamic thresholds with static critical thresholds for mission-critical metrics
- Document the reasoning behind threshold configurations for knowledge sharing
