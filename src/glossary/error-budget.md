## What Is Error Budget

An error budget is a predefined amount of acceptable system downtime or errors within a specific period. It balances the need for system reliability with the pace of innovation.

## Why Is Error Budget Important

Error budgets help teams make informed decisions about when to push new features versus focusing on stability. They create a shared responsibility for reliability between development and operations teams.

## Example Of Error Budget

A company sets a 99.9% uptime goal for their service. This allows for 43 minutes of downtime per month. Teams can use this budget for planned maintenance or new feature deployments.
