## What Is Ground Support Unit

A Ground Support Unit is a specialized team that provides logistical and operational support during major incidents. They handle resource coordination, equipment deployment, and physical infrastructure needs to support incident responders.

## Why Is Ground Support Unit Important

Ground Support Units free up technical responders to focus on incident resolution rather than logistics. They provide crucial infrastructure stability during crisis situations and help maintain operational continuity when normal systems are compromised.

## Example Of Ground Support Unit

During a data center power failure, the Ground Support Unit coordinates generator deployment, manages fuel supplies, arranges emergency cooling systems, and ensures responders have workspaces with power and connectivity to manage the incident.

## How To Build Ground Support Unit

- Identify team members with logistics and operational expertise
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for the unit
- Create resource inventories and supplier contacts
- Develop procedures for rapid deployment
- Train the unit through regular exercises and simulations
