## What Is P0 (Priority Zero)

P0 is the highest incident priority level, representing critical incidents that cause complete service outage or pose severe security threats. These incidents demand immediate attention and often require all-hands response from the organization.

## Why Is P0 Important

P0 incidents have the most severe business impact and require rapid response to minimize damage. They often affect multiple systems or all users of a service and can lead to significant financial losses or reputation damage if not addressed quickly.

## Example Of P0

A complete database failure that renders the entire application unusable for all customers would be classified as P0. Another example is a security breach that exposes sensitive customer data and requires immediate containment.
