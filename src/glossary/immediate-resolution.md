## What Is Immediate Resolution

Immediate Resolution is the rapid fixing of an incident without escalation to other teams or extensive investigation. It typically applies to simple, well-understood issues with established solutions that can be implemented quickly by first responders.

## Why Is Immediate Resolution Important

Immediate Resolution minimizes service disruption and reduces the overall cost of incidents. It prevents minor issues from escalating into major problems and frees up specialized resources to focus on more complex incidents. Quick wins also boost team morale and customer satisfaction.

## Example Of Immediate Resolution

A monitoring alert shows a web server approaching memory limits. The on-call engineer recognizes this as a common issue and immediately restarts the application server process, resolving the problem within minutes before users experience any slowdown.
