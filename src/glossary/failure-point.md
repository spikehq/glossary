## What Is Failure Point

A failure point is a specific component, process, or connection in a system that can malfunction and cause an incident. In incident management, identifying failure points helps teams understand where problems originate and how they propagate through interconnected systems.

## Why Is Failure Point Important

Understanding failure points helps teams respond more effectively to incidents by targeting the root cause rather than symptoms. It also guides preventive measures to strengthen vulnerable areas. Mapping potential failure points in advance speeds up troubleshooting when incidents occur.

## Example Of Failure Point

During a service outage, an incident response team identifies a load balancer as the failure point. While multiple application servers showed errors, the investigation revealed that the load balancer stopped distributing traffic properly. This insight allowed them to restore service quickly by failing over to a backup load balancer.
