## What Is Attack Surface

Attack surface in incident management refers to the total sum of points where unauthorized users could potentially access systems or data. It includes all exposed services, APIs, user interfaces, protocols, and other entry points that could be exploited during a security incident.

## How To Implement Attack Surface Management

- Conduct regular asset inventory to identify all systems and services
- Use scanning tools to discover exposed services and endpoints
- Document all external-facing applications and interfaces
- Implement continuous monitoring of the attack surface
- Regularly review and reduce unnecessary exposure
