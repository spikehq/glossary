## What Is YOY (Year-Over-Year) Incident Analysis

YOY Incident Analysis compares incident data from one year to the same period in the previous year. It helps organizations understand how their incident management performance has changed over time and identify long-term trends in incident occurrence and resolution.

## Why Is YOY Incident Analysis Important

YOY Incident Analysis allows organizations to measure the effectiveness of their incident management strategies over time. It helps identify persistent issues, track improvements, and adjust resources and processes based on long-term trends rather than short-term fluctuations.

## Example Of YOY Incident Analysis

An e-commerce company compares this year's holiday season incidents to last year's. They find a 30% reduction in website downtime incidents, attributing it to infrastructure improvements made earlier in the year.
