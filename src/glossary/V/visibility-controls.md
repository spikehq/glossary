## What Are Visibility Controls

Visibility Controls are settings and permissions that determine who can view incident information within an organization. These controls restrict or grant access to incident details based on roles, responsibilities, or other criteria to maintain security while enabling effective collaboration during incident response.

## Why Are Visibility Controls Important

Visibility Controls protect sensitive information during incidents while ensuring the right people have access to necessary details. They prevent information overload for stakeholders who don't need full visibility and help maintain compliance with security policies and regulations regarding data access.

## Example Of Visibility Controls

In a financial services company, a data breach incident might have visibility restricted to the security team and senior leadership. Meanwhile, a website outage incident might be visible to all IT staff but with certain customer impact details visible only to the customer relations team.

## How To Implement Visibility Controls

- Define clear access levels for different types of incidents
- Implement role-based access controls in your incident management system
- Create policies for incident classification that determine visibility
- Configure notification rules based on visibility requirements
- Regularly audit access logs to verify controls are working properly

## Best Practices

- Design visibility controls that balance security with the need for cross-team collaboration
- Create escalation paths that automatically adjust visibility as incident severity changes
- Implement time-based controls that can temporarily expand visibility during critical incidents
