## What Is Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to files over time, allowing you to track modifications, compare versions, and revert to previous states if needed. In incident management, it helps track changes to configuration files, scripts, and documentation.

## Why Is Version Control Important

During incident response, version control provides accountability and transparency. It helps teams understand what changed, when it changed, and who made the change. This information is vital for troubleshooting, root cause analysis, and preventing similar incidents in the future.

## Example Of Version Control

During a service outage, an engineer makes configuration changes to restore functionality. These changes are committed to a version control system with detailed comments explaining the purpose. Later, when conducting a post-incident review, the team can examine exactly what was modified to resolve the issue.

## How To Implement Version Control

- Select a version control system that meets your team's needs (Git, SVN, etc.)
- Establish conventions for commit messages and branching strategies
- Train team members on proper version control practices
- Integrate version control with your deployment and incident management workflows

## Best Practices

- Make small, focused changes with clear commit messages explaining the purpose
- Use branching strategies that support your incident response processes
- Regularly back up your version control repositories to prevent data loss
