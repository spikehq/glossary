## What Is Virtual Incident Command Center

A Virtual Incident Command Center (VICC) is a digital environment used to coordinate incident response activities. It typically combines communication tools (like chat and video conferencing) with shared dashboards and documentation to facilitate collaboration among responders, regardless of their physical location.

## Why Is Virtual Incident Command Center Important

A VICC provides a centralized hub for communication and information sharing during an incident. It enables effective coordination for distributed teams, ensures everyone works from the same information, and helps maintain a clear command structure.

## Example Of Virtual Incident Command Center

During a major incident, responders join a dedicated video conference bridge (the "war room"). They use a specific chat channel for updates and access a shared dashboard showing real-time metrics and the incident timeline.

## How To Build Virtual Incident Command Center

- Select and configure communication tools (chat, video)
- Set up shared dashboards or status pages
- Define incident command roles and responsibilities clearly
- Establish clear protocols for communication and information flow
- Integrate monitoring and alerting tools to provide context

## Best Practices

- Ensure reliable and accessible communication channels for all responders
- Maintain a clear Incident Commander role to direct efforts
- Keep critical information updated and easily accessible within the VICC
