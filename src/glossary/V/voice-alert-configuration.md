## What Is Voice Alert Configuration

Voice Alert Configuration is the setup and management of phone call notifications within an incident management system. It includes defining when voice calls are triggered, which responders receive them, what information is conveyed, and what actions recipients can take during the call.

## Why Is Voice Alert Configuration Important

Voice Alert Configuration provides a reliable notification method that can break through when other channels fail. Phone calls are harder to ignore than emails or text messages, making them essential for critical incidents. Voice alerts also allow responders to take immediate actions through keypad inputs.

## Example Of Voice Alert Configuration

A critical database failure triggers a voice alert to the on-call database administrator. The automated call describes the issue, reads out error codes, and offers options to acknowledge the incident, escalate to a senior DBA, or join a bridge callâ€”all through simple keypad inputs.

## How To Setup Voice Alert Configuration

- Select a voice notification service that integrates with your incident management platform
- Define escalation policies that include voice calls for critical incidents
- Create voice scripts that clearly communicate incident details
- Configure interactive response options for common actions
- Set up aggregation rules to prevent call fatigue during major incidents

## Best Practices

- Keep voice messages concise but include essential incident details
- Configure voice alerts to include interactive options for quick response
- Set up aggregation rules that combine multiple alerts into a single call to prevent alert fatigue
