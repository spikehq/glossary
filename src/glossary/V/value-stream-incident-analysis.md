## What Is Value Stream Incident Analysis

Value Stream Incident Analysis applies value stream mapping principles to the incident management lifecycle. It involves visualizing the flow of work from incident detection to resolution to identify bottlenecks, waste, and opportunities for improvement.

## Why Is Value Stream Incident Analysis Important

This analysis helps pinpoint inefficiencies in the incident response process. By understanding where delays occur or effort is wasted, teams can streamline workflows, reduce resolution times (MTTR), and improve overall efficiency.

## Example Of Value Stream Incident Analysis

A team maps their incident process and discovers significant delays occur during the initial triage phase before an incident is assigned. This insight leads them to implement automated routing rules to speed up assignment.

## How To Implement Value Stream Incident Analysis

- Map the current incident management process steps.
- Identify value-adding activities versus non-value-adding activities (waste).
- Measure the time taken for each step (lead time, process time).
- Analyze the map to find bottlenecks, handoff delays, or redundant steps.
- Develop and implement improvements based on the findings.

## Best Practices

- Involve team members from all stages of the incident lifecycle.
- Use data (like timestamps from incident records) to inform the map.
- Focus on optimizing the end-to-end flow, not just individual steps.
