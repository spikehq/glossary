## What Is Incident Record

An incident record is a documented entry that captures all the details of an incident from detection to resolution. It includes information such as the incident's description, time of occurrence, affected systems, severity level, assigned responders, and resolution steps taken.

## Why Is Incident Record Important

Incident records provide a complete audit trail of all incidents within an organization. They help teams track response progress, analyze patterns over time, and create a knowledge base for similar future incidents. Well-maintained incident records also support compliance requirements and facilitate post-incident reviews.

## Example Of Incident Record

A database server crashes at 2:15 PM. The incident record captures the timestamp, affected service (customer database), severity (high), assigned responder (Jane Smith), actions taken (server restart and data verification), and resolution time (2:45 PM).
