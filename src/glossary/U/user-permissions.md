## What Are User Permissions

User permissions in incident management are specific access rights granted to individuals based on their roles and responsibilities. These permissions control what actions users can perform within incident management systems, from viewing incidents to modifying their status or accessing sensitive information.

## Why Are User Permissions Important

Properly configured user permissions maintain security while enabling efficient incident response. They protect sensitive data, create accountability through audit trails, and help teams work productively without accessing information beyond their needs.

## Example Of User Permissions

In an incident management platform, permissions are configured so that on-call engineers can acknowledge and update incidents, team leads can create and modify escalation policies, and executives can view dashboards without accessing detailed incident logs containing sensitive customer data.
