## What Is Unresolved Incident

An unresolved incident is an IT service disruption that remains active in the incident management system without a solution or workaround. These incidents continue to impact business operations until they're addressed and require ongoing attention from support teams.

## Why Is Tracking Unresolved Incident Important

Tracking unresolved incidents helps organizations prioritize their response efforts and allocate resources effectively. These incidents often represent ongoing business impact and potential SLA violations that could damage customer trust and satisfaction.

## Example Of Unresolved Incident

A critical payment processing system experiences intermittent failures that support teams can't replicate consistently. Despite multiple troubleshooting attempts, the root cause remains elusive. The incident stays open for three days as teams continue investigating database performance issues.

## How To Implement Unresolved Incident Tracking

- Create a dedicated view in your incident management system for all open incidents
- Establish escalation thresholds based on incident duration (24 hours, 48 hours, etc.)
- Implement regular review meetings for all incidents that remain unresolved beyond set timeframes
- Develop a process for engaging additional expertise when incidents remain unresolved

## Best Practices

- Assign a dedicated incident manager to oversee all long-running unresolved incidents
- Schedule regular status updates to stakeholders for transparency
- Document all troubleshooting steps taken to avoid duplication of effort
