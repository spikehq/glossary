## What Is Unplanned Maintenance

Unplanned maintenance, also known as corrective or reactive maintenance, refers to repair work that occurs unexpectedly due to sudden equipment failures or system malfunctions. Unlike planned maintenance, it's performed as an immediate response to restore services or fix broken components without prior scheduling.

## Why Is Unplanned Maintenance Important

Unplanned maintenance is crucial for minimizing downtime when unexpected failures occur. It helps prevent further damage to equipment, reduces safety hazards, and allows operations to resume quickly. Though reactive by nature, effective unplanned maintenance processes can significantly limit the impact of unforeseen incidents.

## Example Of Unplanned Maintenance

A server crashes unexpectedly during peak business hours, causing a critical application to become unavailable. The IT team must immediately diagnose the issue, replace faulty hardware components, and restore the system to working condition to minimize service disruption.
