## What Is User Experience

User experience in incident management refers to how end users perceive and interact with services during and after an incident. It encompasses the accessibility, performance, and reliability of systems, as well as how well users are informed about issues and their resolution status.

## Why Is User Experience Important

User experience directly affects customer satisfaction and trust. Poor handling of incidents can damage reputation and lead to customer churn. Maintaining positive user experience during incidents demonstrates reliability and builds confidence in your services, even when problems occur.

## Example Of User Experience

During a network outage, a company provides real-time status updates through multiple channels, offers alternative solutions, and communicates expected resolution times. Despite the outage, users feel informed and valued, minimizing frustration and maintaining trust.
