## What Is After-Action Review

An After-Action Review (AAR) is a structured analysis conducted after an incident to identify what happened, why it happened, and how to improve future responses. It's a learning process that examines both successes and failures without assigning blame.

## Why Is After-Action Review Important

AARs create a continuous improvement cycle for incident management. They help teams learn from experience, identify systemic issues, and develop more effective response strategies. Regular AARs build institutional knowledge and prevent recurring problems.

## Example Of After-Action Review

Following a major service outage, a team conducts an AAR and discovers that the incident escalated because monitoring alerts weren't properly routed. They implement new alert routing rules and create clearer escalation paths for similar incidents.

## How To Implement After-Action Review

- Schedule the review within 1-2 weeks after incident resolution
- Include all stakeholders who were involved in the incident
- Focus on timeline reconstruction and root cause analysis
- Document findings and action items with clear ownership
- Share learnings with the broader organization
