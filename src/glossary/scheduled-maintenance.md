## What Is Scheduled Maintenance

Scheduled Maintenance is planned downtime for systems or services to perform updates, patches, hardware replacements, or other preventive work. It involves advance planning, user notification, and coordinated technical activities to minimize disruption while keeping systems reliable and secure.

## Why Is Scheduled Maintenance Important

Scheduled Maintenance prevents unexpected outages by addressing potential issues proactively. It allows teams to plan work during low-traffic periods, minimizing business impact. Regular maintenance also extends system lifespan, improves performance, and keeps security protections current.

## Example Of Scheduled Maintenance

A cloud service provider schedules monthly maintenance for their infrastructure from 2-4 AM on the first Sunday of each month. They notify customers a week in advance, perform security patches and hardware upgrades during this window, and include buffer time for testing before returning to production.
