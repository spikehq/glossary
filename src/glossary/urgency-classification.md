## What Is Urgency Classification

Urgency classification is the process of categorizing incidents based on how quickly they require resolution. It represents the time sensitivity of an incident independent of its impact and helps determine overall incident priority when combined with impact assessment.

## Why Is Urgency Classification Important

Proper urgency classification helps support teams focus on time-sensitive issues first. It creates a standardized approach to incident prioritization that reduces subjective decision-making and helps meet service level agreements consistently.

## Example Of Urgency Classification

A company classifies incident urgency into three levels: High (requires immediate attention), Medium (requires attention within working hours), and Low (can be scheduled). A system outage during peak business hours receives high urgency, while a minor reporting issue might receive low urgency.
