## What Is Release Management

Release management is the process of planning, scheduling, and controlling software builds through different environments to production. In incident management context, it focuses on preventing incidents through proper testing and deployment practices.

## Why Is Release Management Important

Effective release management reduces the risk of deployment-related incidents. It creates stability by ensuring changes are properly tested, coordinated, and communicated, minimizing the chance that new releases will cause service disruptions.

## Example Of Release Management

A SaaS company implements a release management process where all code changes pass through development, testing, staging, and production environments. Each release includes rollback plans and is scheduled during low-traffic periods to minimize potential impact.

## How To Implement Release Management

- Create a standardized release process with clear approval gates
- Implement version control and change tracking
- Establish testing requirements for different release types
- Define rollback procedures for failed deployments
- Schedule releases to minimize business impact

## Best Practices

- Use automation to reduce human error in deployments
- Include incident response teams in release planning
- Conduct post-release reviews to improve future releases
