## What Is Alert Deduplication

Alert Deduplication is the process of identifying and removing duplicate alerts for the same issue. It prevents multiple notifications about the same problem from overwhelming responders and cluttering incident management systems.

## Why Is Alert Deduplication Important

Alert Deduplication reduces noise and prevents alert fatigue among responders. It keeps incident queues clean and focused on unique issues, saves time by eliminating redundant work, and helps teams concentrate on actual problems rather than duplicate notifications.

## Example Of Alert Deduplication

A server sends "high CPU" alerts every minute while a problem persists. Instead of creating 60 separate alerts in an hour, deduplication recognizes these as the same ongoing issue and maintains a single active alert that updates with the latest status.

## How To Implement Alert Deduplication With Spike

- Spike groups repeated alerts from the same source into one incident.
- Incoming alerts update the existing incident with new details, not create a flood.
- You can adjust deduplication rules to match alert sources and payloads.
- No need to worry about missing any updates. Spike keeps a full history inside the incident.
