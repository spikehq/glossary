## What Is Neural Network Monitoring

Neural network monitoring uses artificial intelligence to learn normal system behavior patterns and detect anomalies that traditional threshold-based monitoring might miss. It continuously analyzes multiple metrics simultaneously to identify subtle deviations that indicate potential incidents.

## Why Is Neural Network Monitoring Important

Neural network monitoring catches complex issues that rule-based systems overlook. It reduces false alarms by understanding the relationship between different metrics and adapts to changing environments without manual reconfiguration. This approach detects problems earlier, often before they impact users.

## Example Of Neural Network Monitoring

A neural network monitoring system observes that while CPU usage, memory consumption, and request latency are all within normal ranges individually, their specific combination indicates an abnormal pattern. It generates an alert hours before the application would typically crash.

## How To Implement Neural Network Monitoring

- Collect historical performance data across multiple system components
- Train neural network models on normal operating patterns
- Start with monitoring non-critical systems to refine the model
- Gradually expand coverage to more critical infrastructure
- Integrate with your existing incident management workflow

## Best Practices

- Combine neural network insights with traditional monitoring approaches
- Retrain models periodically as your systems and traffic patterns evolve
- Maintain human oversight to validate and learn from neural network findings
