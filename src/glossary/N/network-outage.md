## What Is a Network Outage

A network outage is a disruption in network connectivity that prevents users from accessing network resources or services. It can range from a localized issue affecting a few users to a widespread problem impacting an entire organization.

## Example of a Network Outage

A faulty router causes a complete loss of internet connectivity for an entire office building, preventing employees from accessing cloud-based services and external communications.

## How to Implement Network Outage Management

- Develop a network outage response plan
- Implement network monitoring tools for quick detection
- Establish redundant network paths to minimize single points of failure
- Create a communication plan for notifying affected users

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular network health checks and preventive maintenance
- Maintain an up-to-date network diagram for faster troubleshooting
- Perform post-outage analysis to prevent similar incidents in the future
