## What Is Notification Escalation

Notification escalation is a systematic process that automatically routes alerts to different team members or groups based on predefined rules when initial notifications go unacknowledged. It creates a hierarchy of responders to handle incidents when primary contacts are unavailable or unresponsive.

## Why Is Notification Escalation Important

Notification escalation prevents incidents from falling through the cracks. It reduces response times by automatically involving additional team members when needed. This process maintains accountability and creates a safety net for critical alerts, especially during off-hours or when primary responders are unavailable.

## Example Of Notification Escalation

When a critical database server fails, the system sends an alert to the primary on-call engineer. If they don't acknowledge within 5 minutes, the alert escalates to a secondary engineer. After another 5 minutes without response, it notifies the entire database team and the IT manager simultaneously.
