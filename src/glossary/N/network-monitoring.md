## What Is Network Monitoring

Network monitoring is the systematic process of observing and analyzing network infrastructure to detect performance issues, outages, and security threats. It involves tracking metrics like bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, and device status to maintain optimal network health and quickly identify potential problems.

## Why Is Network Monitoring Important

Network monitoring provides early warning of developing issues before they cause major disruptions. It helps incident teams identify the root cause of problems faster, reduces downtime, and supports capacity planning. Without proper monitoring, incidents often go undetected until users report them, increasing resolution time and business impact.

## Example Of Network Monitoring

A healthcare system implements network monitoring across its hospital campuses. When unusual traffic patterns emerge on a critical network segment, the monitoring system automatically alerts the IT team, who discover and block a malware infection before it can spread to patient care systems.

## How To Implement Network Monitoring

- Identify critical network components and services that require monitoring
- Deploy monitoring tools that support your network architecture
- Configure appropriate thresholds and alert conditions
- Create a notification strategy for different alert severities
- Integrate monitoring data with your incident management platform

## Best Practices

- Monitor from both inside and outside your network for complete visibility
- Use baseline measurements to detect abnormal patterns and performance changes
- Implement automated responses for common issues to reduce resolution time
