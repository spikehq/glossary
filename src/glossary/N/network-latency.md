## What Is Network Latency

Network latency is the time delay between sending and receiving data across a network. In incident management, high latency can impact system performance and user experience, potentially triggering incidents.

## Example of Network Latency

A company's video conferencing system experiences delays and poor quality due to high network latency, disrupting important client meetings.

## How to Implement Network Latency Monitoring

- Deploy network performance monitoring tools
- Establish baseline latency metrics for normal operations
- Set up alerts for abnormal latency spikes
- Regularly test network paths for latency issues

## Best Practices

- Optimize network infrastructure to minimize latency
- Prioritize traffic for latency-sensitive applications
- Educate users on factors that can contribute to network latency
