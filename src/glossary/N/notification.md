## What Is Notification

A notification is an automated or manual alert sent to individuals or teams about an incident, system change, or important event. In incident management, notifications inform relevant stakeholders about detected issues, their status, and required actions through channels like email, SMS, phone calls, or mobile apps.

## Why Is Notification Important

Effective notifications reduce response time by quickly alerting the right people when incidents occur. They provide critical information needed to begin troubleshooting, coordinate response efforts, and keep stakeholders informed. Well-designed notifications help prevent alert fatigue while ensuring critical issues receive proper attention.

## Example Of Notification

When a database server reaches 95% disk capacity at midnight, an automated notification system alerts the on-call database administrator via SMS and phone call. The message includes the server name, current disk usage, and a link to the incident details, allowing immediate action to prevent service disruption.
