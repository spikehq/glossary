## What Is Network Dependency Mapping

Network dependency mapping is the process of documenting and visualizing the relationships between network components, services, and applications. It creates a comprehensive view of how different parts of your infrastructure depend on each other.

## Why Is Network Dependency Mapping Important

Network dependency mapping helps incident responders quickly identify the potential impact of failures. It speeds up troubleshooting by showing which components might be causing cascading issues and allows teams to prioritize fixes based on dependency chains.

## Example Of Network Dependency Mapping

A map shows that the customer portal depends on the authentication service, which relies on a specific database cluster. When the database experiences issues, responders immediately understand which user-facing services will be affected.

## How To Do Network Dependency Mapping

- Inventory all network components, services, and applications
- Document connections and dependencies between components
- Create visual representations of these relationships
- Update maps whenever infrastructure changes occur
- Share dependency maps with incident response teams

## Best Practices

- Use automated discovery tools to maintain accurate dependency information
- Include both technical and business service dependencies in your maps
- Keep maps simple enough to be useful during high-pressure incident situations
