## What Is Notification Routing

Notification routing is the process of directing incident alerts to the appropriate individuals or teams based on predefined rules and criteria. It determines who receives notifications about specific incidents, through which channels, and with what priority level.

## Why Is Notification Routing Important

Effective notification routing reduces response times by alerting the right people immediately. It prevents alert fatigue by ensuring team members only receive relevant notifications and helps distribute workload evenly across support teams.

## Example Of Notification Routing

When a database server issue occurs, the notification system automatically routes alerts to the database administration team via their preferred channels (SMS for critical issues, email for non-critical). Meanwhile, network issues are routed to the network operations team.
