## What Is Diagnosis

Diagnosis is the process of investigating and identifying the root cause of an incident. It involves analyzing symptoms, examining logs and metrics, and using troubleshooting techniques to determine what went wrong and why it happened.

## Why Is Diagnosis Important

Proper diagnosis prevents treating symptoms instead of causes. Without accurate diagnosis, teams waste time implementing ineffective fixes that don't address the underlying problem. Good diagnostic processes lead to faster resolution times and prevent incident recurrence.

## Example Of Diagnosis

After receiving alerts about API timeouts, an engineer examines system logs and discovers a memory leak in a recently deployed service. Further investigation reveals that the leak occurs only when processing certain types of requests, leading to the exact code causing the issue.

## How To Implement Diagnosis

- Gather data from monitoring tools, logs, and affected systems
- Look for patterns and correlations between symptoms and events
- Use a systematic approach to test hypotheses about the cause
- Document findings and evidence throughout the process
- Share diagnostic information with the resolution team

## Best Practices

- Create diagnostic runbooks for common issues to speed up the process
- Use collaboration tools to involve the right experts early in diagnosis
- Avoid jumping to conclusionsâ€”verify causes with evidence before acting
