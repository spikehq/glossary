## What Is Audit

An audit in incident management is a systematic review of incident records, response procedures, and resolution processes to verify compliance with established protocols and identify areas for improvement.

## Why Is Audit Important

Audits maintain accountability in incident management by documenting who did what and when. They help identify process gaps, verify compliance with regulatory requirements, and provide evidence for stakeholders that incidents are handled properly.

## Example Of Audit

During a quarterly security audit, a financial services company reviews all incident response times and discovers that weekend incidents take 40% longer to resolve. This finding leads to improved weekend staffing and updated escalation procedures.

## How To Audit

- Define the scope and objectives of your incident management audit
- Gather relevant documentation and incident records
- Interview key personnel involved in incident response
- Compare actual practices against documented procedures
- Document findings and recommendations for improvement

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular audits on a scheduled basis, not just after major incidents
- Create actionable recommendations with clear ownership and timelines
