## What Is Yearly Incident Review

A Yearly Incident Review is an annual assessment of all major incidents that occurred within an organization. It involves analyzing incident reports, response times, and resolution strategies to identify patterns and areas for improvement in incident management processes.

## Why Is Yearly Incident Review Important

Yearly Incident Reviews help organizations learn from past experiences, refine their incident response strategies, and prevent recurring issues. They provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of current processes and highlight areas that need attention or resources.

## Example Of Yearly Incident Review

An IT company reviews all major outages from the past year. They discover that 60% of incidents were related to database failures. This insight leads them to invest in more robust database monitoring and backup systems for the coming year.
