## What Is Service Mapping Dashboard

A Service Mapping Dashboard is a visual tool that displays the relationships and dependencies between different IT services, applications, and infrastructure components within an organization. It provides a real-time view of how services interconnect and impact each other.

## Why Is Service Mapping Dashboard Important

Service Mapping Dashboards help teams quickly identify the root cause of incidents by showing how issues in one service affect others. They improve incident response times, aid in impact assessment, and support proactive problem management.

## Example Of Service Mapping Dashboard

During a database outage, the service mapping dashboard shows that three customer-facing applications depend on this database. It also reveals that the payment processing system uses a separate database and remains unaffected. This information helps the team communicate accurately about the incident's scope.

## How To Build Service Mapping Dashboard

- Inventory all IT services and their components
- Use automated discovery tools to map relationships
- Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems
- Regularly update the map as your infrastructure changes
- Train teams on how to interpret and use the dashboard

## Best Practices

- Keep the dashboard simple and intuitive
- Use color coding to indicate service health status
- Include critical business services for better context
