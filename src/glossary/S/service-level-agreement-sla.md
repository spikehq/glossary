## What Is Service Level Agreement (SLA)

A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider and a customer that defines the expected level of service. In incident management, SLAs typically specify response times, resolution times, and other performance metrics for handling incidents.

## Why Is Service Level Agreement (SLA) Important

SLAs set clear expectations for incident response and resolution. They help maintain accountability, measure performance, and ensure consistent service quality. SLAs also provide a framework for continuous improvement in incident management processes.

## Example Of Service Level Agreement (SLA)

An IT support SLA might state that all high-severity incidents must be acknowledged within 15 minutes and resolved within 4 hours. This sets clear expectations for both the support team and the customers.

## How To Implement Service Level Agreement (SLA)

- Identify key performance metrics for incident management
- Define realistic and achievable service levels
- Document SLAs clearly and make them accessible to all parties
- Implement monitoring tools to track SLA compliance
- Establish regular review processes to assess and improve SLAs

## Best Practices

- Tailor SLAs to different service types and customer needs
- Include both quantitative and qualitative measures in SLAs
