## What Is Service Level Indicator (SLI)

A Service Level Indicator (SLI) is a specific metric used to measure the performance of a service. In incident management, SLIs often include metrics like incident response time, resolution time, or system uptime percentage.

## Why Is Service Level Indicator (SLI) Important

SLIs provide concrete, measurable data points to assess service quality and performance. They help teams track progress, identify areas for improvement, and demonstrate compliance with SLAs. SLIs form the foundation for setting and evaluating Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

## Example Of Service Level Indicator (SLI)

An SLI for an incident management system might be "percentage of high-severity incidents acknowledged within 15 minutes." This metric directly measures a specific aspect of the incident response process.
