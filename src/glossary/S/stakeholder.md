## What Is Stakeholder

A stakeholder in incident management is any individual, team, or entity affected by or having influence over an incident and its resolution. This includes technical teams, management, customers, and third-party vendors who have a vested interest in the incident's outcome.

## Why Is Stakeholder Important

Stakeholders provide critical perspectives and resources during incidents. Their involvement helps prioritize response efforts, allocate resources effectively, and maintain clear communication channels. Proper stakeholder management prevents misalignment and speeds up incident resolution.

## Example Of Stakeholder

During a payment processing outage, stakeholders include the engineering team working on the fix, customer support handling user complaints, the finance department tracking revenue impact, and customers experiencing failed transactions.
