## What Are Self-healing Systems

Self-healing Systems are IT infrastructures designed to automatically detect, diagnose, and fix problems without human intervention. These systems use predefined rules, automation, and sometimes AI to identify issues and apply remediation steps to restore normal operations.

## Why Are Self-healing Systems Important

Self-healing Systems reduce downtime by addressing issues before they escalate into major incidents. They minimize the need for manual intervention, allowing IT teams to focus on more complex problems. This capability is especially valuable during off-hours when staff availability is limited.

## Example Of Self-healing Systems

A web server begins experiencing high CPU usage. The self-healing system detects this anomaly, automatically restarts the problematic service, and scales up additional resources. It then verifies the problem is resolved and logs the incident for later review.

## How To Implement Self-healing Systems

- Identify common failure scenarios that can be automated
- Create clear detection mechanisms for each scenario
- Develop safe, tested remediation scripts
- Implement verification steps to confirm successful recovery
- Build in logging and notification capabilities

## Best Practices

- Design remediation actions that cannot make problems worse
- Include circuit breakers to prevent infinite retry loops
- Maintain human oversight with clear logs of all automated actions
