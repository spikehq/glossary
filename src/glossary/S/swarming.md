## What Is Swarming

Swarming is an incident response approach where multiple specialists collaborate simultaneously on an incident rather than following traditional tiered escalation. This model brings together experts from various domains to work collectively on problem-solving from the start.

## Why Is Swarming Important

Swarming reduces resolution time by eliminating handoffs between support tiers. It leverages collective expertise to solve complex problems faster, improves knowledge sharing across teams, and creates more engaging work for technical specialists.

## Example Of Swarming

When a critical payment service fails, instead of escalating through tiers, the organization immediately forms a swarm with database specialists, network engineers, application developers, and security experts who collaborate in real-time to diagnose and fix the issue.

## How To Implement Swarming

- Identify which incident types benefit most from swarming
- Create channels for rapid assembly of cross-functional teams
- Establish clear roles within swarms (coordinator, subject matter experts)
- Develop tools for real-time collaboration and information sharing
- Train teams on effective swarming practices

## Best Practices

- Designate a swarm coordinator to keep efforts focused and organized
- Document discoveries and solutions during swarming for future reference
- Set clear exit criteria for when the swarm can disband
