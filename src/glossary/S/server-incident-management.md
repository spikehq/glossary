## What Is Serverless Incident Management

Serverless Incident Management is an approach to handling IT incidents using cloud-based serverless computing platforms. It leverages event-driven functions that automatically scale in response to incidents without requiring management of the underlying infrastructure.

## Why Is Serverless Incident Management Important

Serverless Incident Management provides cost-effective scalability during incident response. Teams pay only for the computing resources used during an actual incident. This approach eliminates the need to maintain dedicated incident management infrastructure that sits idle between events.

## Example Of Serverless Incident Management

When a monitoring system detects an API failure, it triggers a serverless function that creates an incident ticket, notifies the on-call team, collects diagnostic data, and launches a virtual war room. All these functions scale automatically based on the incident's severity.

## How To Implement Serverless Incident Management

- Select a serverless platform that meets your requirements
- Design event-driven workflows for incident detection and response
- Create functions for common incident management tasks
- Set up appropriate triggers and integrations
- Test thoroughly under various incident scenarios
- Monitor function performance and costs

## Best Practices

- Design functions to be stateless and idempotent
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Set appropriate timeouts and concurrency limits for functions
