## What Is System Outage

A system outage is a period when a computer system, service, or application becomes unavailable or non-functional for its intended users. Outages can be planned (maintenance) or unplanned (failures), and may affect entire systems or specific components.

## Example Of System Outage

An e-commerce platform experiences a two-hour outage during a major sale when its payment processing system fails due to unexpected traffic volume. The company loses revenue, frustrates customers, and damages its reputation.
