## What Is Status Page

A Status Page is a dedicated webpage that displays the current operational status of an organization's services, applications, and infrastructure. It provides real-time updates about ongoing incidents, planned maintenance, and system performance to keep users informed about service availability.

## Why Is Status Page Important

A Status Page reduces support ticket volume by proactively informing users about known issues. It builds trust through transparency, demonstrates accountability during outages, and serves as a central communication channel during incidents. This transparency helps manage user expectations and reduces frustration.

## Example Of Status Page

During a cloud service disruption, a company's Status Page shows a partial outage in their authentication system with a yellow warning indicator. It includes a timeline of the incident, current status, and estimated resolution time. Users can subscribe to updates via email or SMS.
