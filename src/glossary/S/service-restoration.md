## What Is Service Restoration

Service Restoration is the process of returning affected systems to normal operation after an incident. It focuses on minimizing downtime by quickly restoring functionality, even if temporary measures are needed while permanent fixes are developed.

## Why Is Service Restoration Important

Service Restoration directly impacts user experience and business continuity. Quick restoration minimizes financial and reputational damage from outages. It separates the immediate need to restore service from the longer process of permanent resolution, allowing businesses to recover faster.

## Example Of Service Restoration

A web application experiences database connection failures. The incident team restores service by implementing a connection pooling solution and adding more database replicas. This restores functionality while they work on the underlying connection management issue.

## How To Implement Service Restoration

- Develop restoration procedures for critical services in advance
- Create a decision framework for choosing between restoration options
- Maintain backup systems and redundant components
- Practice restoration procedures regularly
- Document temporary fixes applied during restoration
- Verify service functionality after restoration
