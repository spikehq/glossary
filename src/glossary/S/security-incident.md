## What Is Security Incident

A security incident is an event that violates security policies, compromises data integrity, or threatens system confidentiality or availability. It includes unauthorized access attempts, data breaches, malware infections, and other events that pose security risks to an organization.

## Example of Security Incident

A company detects unusual login patterns indicating a brute force attack against their customer database. The security team blocks the suspicious IP addresses, forces password resets for affected accounts, and investigates the scope of the potential breach.

## How To Implement Security Incident Response

- Create a dedicated security incident response plan
- Form a specialized security incident response team
- Deploy security monitoring and detection tools
- Establish clear escalation paths for different types of security incidents
- Develop containment, eradication, and recovery procedures
- Prepare communication templates for different security scenarios

## Best Practices

- Train all staff on security awareness and incident reporting procedures
- Conduct regular security incident simulations to test response readiness
- Maintain relationships with external security resources and law enforcement
