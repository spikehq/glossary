## What Is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

A Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) in incident management is a documented set of step-by-step instructions that guide teams through handling specific types of incidents. SOPs standardize response actions, reduce human error, and create consistency in incident handling.

## Why Is Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Important

SOPs remove guesswork during high-pressure situations, allowing responders to follow proven methods instead of improvising. They preserve institutional knowledge, speed up response times, and help new team members contribute effectively during incidents.

## Example Of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

An SOP for database failure might include: steps to verify the outage, commands to check specific error logs, a decision tree for common database issues, escalation contacts, and recovery procedures for different failure scenarios.

## How To Create Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

- Document current best practices for handling common incidents
- Include clear triggers for when each SOP should be activated
- Create flowcharts or checklists for complex procedures
- Store SOPs in an easily accessible location for all team members
- Review and update SOPs after significant incidents

## Best Practices

- Keep SOPs concise with clear, actionable steps
- Include decision points and alternative paths for different scenarios
- Regularly test SOPs through simulations or tabletop exercises
