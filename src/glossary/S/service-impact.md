## What Is Service Impact

Service impact refers to the effect an incident has on business operations, user experience, or system functionality. It measures the scope, severity, and business consequences of an incident, helping teams prioritize their response efforts appropriately.

## Why Assessing Service Impact Important

Accurately assessing service impact helps incident teams allocate resources effectively, communicate appropriately with stakeholders, and make informed decisions during crisis situations. It provides context for the business significance of technical problems.

## Example of Service Impact

A payment processing outage affects 30% of customers during non-peak hours. The incident response team classifies this as "high impact" because it directly prevents revenue generation, even though it affects a limited subset of users during a lower-traffic period.

## How To Assess Service Impact

- Create a standardized impact classification system (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- Define clear criteria for each impact level based on user numbers, business functions, and revenue effects
- Develop impact assessment questions for incident responders
- Integrate impact assessment into incident management workflows
- Regularly review and update impact criteria based on business changes
