## What Is Outage

An outage is an unplanned interruption or loss of service in a system, network, application, or infrastructure component that prevents users from accessing resources or performing normal operations. Outages can range from brief disruptions affecting limited functionality to complete system failures impacting entire organizations.

## Example Of Outage

A cloud service provider experiences a network failure that takes down their authentication system. As a result, thousands of customers cannot log into their accounts or access critical services for several hours, leading to business disruptions and financial losses.
