## What Is Break-Fix

Break-fix is a reactive approach to incident management where problems are addressed only after they cause a failure or disruption. This model focuses on returning systems to operational status quickly rather than preventing future incidents or addressing root causes.

## Why Is Break-Fix Important

Understanding the break-fix model helps organizations recognize its limitations. While sometimes necessary for urgent issues, relying solely on break-fix approaches leads to recurring problems and inefficient resource use. Recognizing when you're stuck in a break-fix cycle is the first step toward more proactive incident management.

## Example Of Break-Fix

A company's payment processing system crashes during peak business hours. The incident response team restarts the service and applies a quick patch to resolve the immediate issue. They move on to other tasks without investigating why the system failed or implementing preventive measures, only to face the same problem a week later.

## How To Implement Break-Fix

- Create a system for reporting and tracking incidents
- Establish clear escalation paths for different types of failures
- Develop standard procedures for common break-fix scenarios
- Build a knowledge base of quick fixes for recurring issues
- Track metrics on frequency and impact of break-fix incidents

## Best Practices

- Document all break-fix actions for future reference
- Allocate time after urgent fixes to investigate root causes
- Gradually transition high-impact break-fix scenarios to preventive approaches
