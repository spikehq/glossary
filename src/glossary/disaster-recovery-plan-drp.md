## What Is Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP)

A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is a documented, structured approach that describes how an organization will recover and restore critical IT infrastructure and systems following a disaster. It contains step-by-step procedures, contact information, resource requirements, and recovery priorities.

## Why Is Disaster Recovery Plan Important

A well-designed DRP eliminates guesswork during crisis situations. It provides clear guidance when teams are under extreme pressure, reduces human error, and shortens recovery time. Without a formal plan, recovery efforts become chaotic and inefficient, extending downtime and increasing costs.

## Example Of Disaster Recovery Plan

A financial institution's DRP specifies that if their primary payment processing system fails, the team must first verify the failure, then activate the standby system within 15 minutes. The plan details exactly who makes the decision, which commands to execute, and how to verify successful failover.

## How To Create Disaster Recovery Plan

- Conduct a business impact analysis to identify critical systems
- Define recovery objectives and priorities for each system
- Document detailed recovery procedures and responsibilities
- Secure necessary resources and technologies to support the plan
- Establish a testing and maintenance schedule

## Best Practices

- Keep the plan accessible during disasters (both digital and physical copies)
- Train all relevant staff on their roles in the recovery process
- Test the plan regularly through tabletop exercises and full simulations
