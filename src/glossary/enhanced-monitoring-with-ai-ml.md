## What Is Enhanced Monitoring With AI/ML

Enhanced Monitoring with AI/ML uses artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to improve incident detection by analyzing patterns in system behavior. It goes beyond static thresholds to identify anomalies, predict potential failures, and reduce false positives in monitoring systems.

## Why Is Enhanced Monitoring With AI/ML Important

Traditional monitoring relies on predefined thresholds that often trigger false alarms or miss subtle issues. AI/ML monitoring adapts to normal behavior patterns and detects unusual deviations that might indicate problems. This approach reduces alert fatigue while catching more genuine incidents before they impact users.

## Example Of Enhanced Monitoring With AI/ML

A cloud service provider implements AI-based monitoring that learns normal traffic patterns for each customer application. When one application shows unusual memory consumption that doesn't violate absolute thresholds but deviates from its typical pattern, the system flags it for investigation, preventing a potential outage.

## How To Implement Enhanced Monitoring With AI/ML

- Collect comprehensive baseline data across systems
- Select appropriate AI/ML models for your specific monitoring needs
- Start with supervised learning for known issues, then expand to anomaly detection
- Implement feedback loops where responders validate AI findings
- Gradually increase automation as confidence in the system grows

## Best Practices

- Begin with a hybrid approach that combines traditional and AI-based monitoring
- Train models on both normal operations and incident scenarios
- Continuously refine models based on false positives and missed incidents
