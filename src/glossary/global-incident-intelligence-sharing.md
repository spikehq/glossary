## What Is Global Incident Intelligence Sharing

Global Incident Intelligence Sharing is a collaborative approach where organizations exchange information about security incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities across geographical boundaries. This practice helps incident response teams stay informed about emerging threats and effective response strategies used by other organizations worldwide.

## Why Is Global Incident Intelligence Sharing Important

Global Incident Intelligence Sharing reduces duplicate efforts in incident analysis and speeds up response times. When organizations share threat intelligence, they create a collective defense that helps all participants identify similar attacks and implement proven remediation strategies. This collaboration is particularly valuable for addressing sophisticated threats that target multiple organizations.

## Example Of Global Incident Intelligence Sharing

A financial institution detects a new ransomware variant targeting their systems. They immediately share the attack patterns, indicators of compromise, and mitigation strategies with their industry's intelligence sharing network. This allows other financial organizations to implement preventive measures before being targeted.

## How To Implement Global Incident Intelligence Sharing

- Join established threat intelligence sharing communities like FS-ISAC or IT-ISAC
- Implement standardized formats (STIX/TAXII) for sharing incident data
- Create clear policies about what information can be shared externally
- Establish secure communication channels for intelligence exchange
- Develop processes to quickly act on received intelligence

## Best Practices

- Balance detail and speed—share critical information quickly, then follow up with more details
- Anonymize sensitive data while preserving the valuable context of incidents
- Contribute actively, not just consume—intelligence sharing works best when reciprocal
