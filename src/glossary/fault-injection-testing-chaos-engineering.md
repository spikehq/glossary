## What Is Fault Injection Testing (Chaos Engineering)

Fault injection testing, also known as chaos engineering, is a disciplined approach to improving system resilience by deliberately introducing failures in controlled environments. This practice helps teams understand how systems respond to disruptions and identify weaknesses before they cause real incidents.

## Why Is Fault Injection Testing Important

Fault injection testing builds confidence in system resilience by revealing hidden vulnerabilities and response gaps. It helps teams develop better incident response procedures, create more robust systems, and reduce the impact of actual failures when they occur.

## Example of Fault Injection Testing

A payment processing company runs a controlled experiment where they simulate the failure of a primary database server during low-traffic hours. They observe how their systems handle the failover process and identify a delay in routing traffic to backup servers that they can fix before it affects customers.

## How to Do Fault Injection Testing

- Start with a hypothesis about how your system should respond to specific failures
- Define the scope and blast radius of experiments
- Create a controlled testing environment that mimics production
- Monitor system behavior during experiments
- Document findings and implement improvements

## Best Practices

- Begin with small, contained experiments and gradually increase complexity
- Run tests in production-like environments before moving to actual production
- Establish abort conditions to stop experiments if they cause unexpected damage
