## What Is Recovery

Recovery in incident management is the process of restoring systems, services, or operations back to normal functioning after an incident or outage. It involves implementing solutions to fix the issue and returning affected components to their expected operational state.

## Why Is Recovery Important

Recovery directly impacts business continuity and customer satisfaction. Quick and effective recovery minimizes downtime costs, preserves company reputation, and reduces the overall business impact of incidents. It's the critical final phase that determines how quickly normal operations can resume.

## Example Of Recovery

During a database server crash, the recovery process involves identifying the failed components, restoring from backups, validating data integrity, and gradually bringing services back online. The team follows their recovery checklist while keeping stakeholders updated on progress.

## How To Implement Recovery

- Create detailed recovery procedures for different incident types
- Assign clear roles and responsibilities for recovery tasks
- Test recovery processes regularly through simulations
- Document recovery steps taken during actual incidents
- Establish communication protocols for recovery status updates

## Best Practices

- Prioritize recovery of critical systems first based on business impact
- Validate system functionality before declaring full recovery
- Conduct a brief post-recovery assessment to identify improvements
