## What Is Mean Time To Diagnose (MTTD)

Mean Time to Diagnose (MTTD) is the average time between when an incident is detected and when its root cause is identified. This metric measures how efficiently teams can troubleshoot and pinpoint the source of problems.

## Why Is MTTD Important

Diagnosis speed directly impacts resolution time. Accurate and quick diagnosis allows teams to apply the right fix faster. This metric helps identify knowledge gaps, tool limitations, or process inefficiencies in troubleshooting workflows.

## Example Of MTTD

A website becomes unavailable at 3:30 PM. After investigation, engineers determine at 4:15 PM that a recent code deployment caused the outage. The MTTD is 45 minutes.

## How To Track MTTD

- Record timestamps for incident detection and diagnosis confirmation
- Maintain detailed incident logs with troubleshooting steps
- Calculate average diagnosis time across different incident types
- Review complex incidents to identify diagnostic challenges
- Invest in tools that accelerate root cause analysis

## Best Practices

- Create diagnostic playbooks for common incident types
- Maintain updated system documentation and architecture diagrams
- Use correlation tools to connect related symptoms and events
