## What Is Mutual Aid Agreement

A Mutual Aid Agreement is a formal arrangement between organizations to provide assistance to each other during incidents or emergencies that exceed their individual response capabilities. These agreements define the terms, conditions, and procedures for requesting and providing support.

## Why Is Mutual Aid Important

Mutual Aid Agreements strengthen incident response capabilities by allowing organizations to share resources, expertise, and personnel during major incidents. They create a support network that helps maintain service continuity, reduce recovery time, and mitigate the impact of large-scale incidents.

## Example Of Mutual Aid

Two regional hospitals establish a mutual aid agreement for IT disaster recovery. When Hospital A experiences a ransomware attack that compromises their electronic health record system, Hospital B provides temporary server capacity and technical staff to help restore critical services.
