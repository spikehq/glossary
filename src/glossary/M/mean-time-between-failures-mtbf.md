## What Is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) is the average time between the start of one incident and the start of the next incident for a specific system or service. This metric measures system reliability and stability over time.

## Why Is MTBF Important

MTBF helps organizations understand system reliability and predict future failures. Higher MTBF indicates more stable systems with fewer disruptions. This metric guides maintenance schedules and infrastructure investments.

## Example Of MTBF

A production server experiences failures on January 5, January 25, and February 10. The MTBF would be approximately 18 days, calculated as the average time between these consecutive failures.

## How To Track MTBF

- Maintain detailed records of all system failures
- Define clear criteria for what constitutes a failure
- Calculate MTBF for individual components and overall systems
- Track MTBF trends over time to identify improving or degrading reliability
- Compare MTBF across similar systems to identify outliers

## Best Practices

- Separate MTBF calculations by incident type and severity
- Use MTBF data to guide preventive maintenance schedules
- Analyze systems with decreasing MTBF for potential underlying issues
