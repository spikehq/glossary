## What Are Mobile Alerts

Mobile Alerts are notifications sent to smartphones or tablets to inform incident response teams about system issues, outages, or other events requiring attention. These alerts can be delivered through SMS, push notifications, or dedicated incident management apps.

## Why Are Mobile Alerts Important

Mobile Alerts extend incident management beyond the office by reaching responders wherever they are. They speed up incident response times, provide critical information on the go, and allow teams to begin troubleshooting before reaching a computer.

## Example Of Mobile Alerts

An e-commerce company's payment processing service experiences an error at 2 AM. The monitoring system sends a high-priority mobile alert to the on-call engineer with error details and affected systems. The engineer acknowledges the alert and begins investigation immediately from their phone.
