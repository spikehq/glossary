## What Is Monitoring

Monitoring is the continuous observation and checking of IT systems, applications, and infrastructure to detect issues, track performance, and identify anomalies. In incident management, monitoring tools collect data from various sources to alert teams when metrics exceed normal thresholds or when failures occur.

## Why Is Monitoring Important

Monitoring forms the foundation of effective incident management by enabling early detection of problems before they impact users. It provides visibility into system health, helps teams respond proactively to emerging issues, and supplies valuable data for troubleshooting and root cause analysis during incidents.

## Example Of Monitoring

A cloud service provider uses monitoring tools to track server CPU usage across their infrastructure. When a database server reaches 90% CPU utilization, the monitoring system triggers an alert to the on-call engineer who investigates before the high load causes service degradation.

## How To Implement Monitoring

- Define critical metrics and thresholds for your systems and services
- Select and deploy appropriate monitoring tools for different components
- Configure alerts with proper routing and severity levels
- Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison
- Integrate monitoring with your incident management platform

## Best Practices

- Focus on actionable alerts that indicate real problems requiring human intervention
- Implement monitoring at multiple levels (infrastructure, application, business metrics)
- Regularly review and refine monitoring rules to reduce alert noise and fatigue
