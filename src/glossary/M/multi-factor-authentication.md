## What Is Multi-factor Authentication

Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is a security method that requires users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to systems or applications. These factors typically include something you know (password), something you have (security token), and something you are (biometric verification).

## Why Is Multi-factor Authentication Important

In incident management, MFA helps prevent unauthorized access to critical systems during incidents. It adds an essential security layer when emergency access is needed, protects sensitive incident data, and maintains compliance with security policies even during high-pressure situations.

## Example Of Multi-factor Authentication

During a major service outage, an on-call engineer receives an alert and needs to access production systems. Besides entering their password, they must also approve a push notification on their authenticator app before gaining access to troubleshoot the issue.

## How To Implement Multi-factor Authentication

- Identify critical systems that require additional protection
- Select appropriate authentication factors based on security requirements
- Deploy MFA solutions that integrate with your existing systems
- Create emergency access procedures that maintain security while enabling rapid response
- Train team members on proper MFA usage during incidents

## Best Practices

- Balance security with usability to avoid delays during critical incidents
- Establish backup authentication methods in case primary methods fail
- Document clear procedures for emergency access when normal authentication channels are unavailable
