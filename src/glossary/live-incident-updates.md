## What Are Live Incident Updates

Live Incident Updates are real-time communications shared during an active incident that provide stakeholders with current status, progress, and expected resolution times. These updates flow continuously as an incident unfolds, keeping teams aligned and informed without requiring manual check-ins.

## Why Are Live Incident Updates Important

Live updates reduce confusion during critical incidents by providing a single source of truth. They eliminate the need for scattered communications, decrease interruptions to responders, and help management make informed decisions. Transparent updates also build trust with affected customers and teams.

## Example Of Live Incident Updates

During a database outage, an incident commander posts updates every 15 minutes to a dedicated Slack channel: "Database connectivity issue identified at 2:15 PM. Root cause appears to be network partition. DBA team implementing fix. ETA for resolution: 3:00 PM. Next update in 15 minutes."

## How To Implement Live Incident Updates

- Create dedicated communication channels for incident updates
- Assign a communications lead separate from technical responders
- Use templates to maintain consistency in updates
- Set regular update intervals based on incident severity
- Integrate your incident management tool with communication platforms

## Best Practices

- Keep updates concise and jargon-free for all audience levels
- Include current status, actions taken, and next steps in each update
- Maintain a regular cadence even when there's little new information
