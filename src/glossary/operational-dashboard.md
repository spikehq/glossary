## What Is Operational Dashboard

An operational dashboard is a visual display that shows real-time data about the current state of IT systems and services. It presents key metrics, status indicators, and alerts in an easy-to-understand format, giving teams immediate visibility into system health and performance.

## Why Is Operational Dashboard Important

Operational dashboards provide at-a-glance visibility into system status, helping teams spot issues before they become critical. They improve response time by centralizing important information and create a shared understanding of system health across different teams. Dashboards also help prioritize work by highlighting the most urgent issues.

## Example Of Operational Dashboard

A company's IT operations team uses a dashboard that displays the status of all critical services. The dashboard shows green, yellow, or red indicators for each service, current incident count, response time metrics, and a timeline of recent alerts. When database performance degrades, the database service indicator turns yellow, prompting the team to investigate before users notice problems.

## How To Build Operational Dashboard

- Identify the most important metrics and status indicators to display
- Choose a dashboard tool that integrates with your monitoring systems
- Design layouts that highlight critical information effectively
- Set up automated data refreshes at appropriate intervals
- Make dashboards accessible to everyone who needs them

## Best Practices

- Keep dashboards simple and focused on actionable information
- Use consistent color coding and visual elements across all dashboards
- Include historical context alongside current status when possible
