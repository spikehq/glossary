## What Is Business Service

A business service is a set of related functions that support core business activities. In incident management, it refers to the IT services that directly enable or support these business functions, such as email systems, customer databases, or e-commerce platforms.

## Example Of Business Service

For an online retailer, the e-commerce platform is a critical business service. Any incident affecting this service, such as website downtime or payment processing issues, would have a direct impact on sales and customer satisfaction.
