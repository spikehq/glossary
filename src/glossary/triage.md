## What Is Triage

Triage is the process of quickly assessing and prioritizing incoming incidents or alerts. It determines the urgency and impact of each issue to decide the order of response.

## Why Is Triage Important

Triage helps teams focus on the most critical issues first. It efficiently allocates resources and prevents delays in addressing high-impact incidents. This process minimizes business disruption.

## Example Of Triage

A security operations center receives many alerts daily. An analyst quickly reviews each alert. They determine if it's a false alarm, a minor issue, or a serious threat requiring immediate action.
