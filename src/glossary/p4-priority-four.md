## What Is P4 (Priority Four)

P4 is the lowest incident priority level, representing trivial issues that have minimal or no impact on users or business operations. These are often cosmetic issues, minor bugs in non-critical features, or suggestions for improvement.

## Why Is P4 Important

P4 incidents help maintain overall system quality and user satisfaction over time. While not urgent, addressing these issues demonstrates attention to detail and commitment to continuous improvement.

## Example Of P4

A typo in documentation, a slight color mismatch in the UI, or a feature enhancement request would typically be classified as P4. These issues don't affect functionality but may impact the polish or user experience of a product.
