## What Is Time to Respond

Time to Respond is the duration between when an incident is acknowledged and when active troubleshooting or remediation work begins. This metric measures how quickly your team transitions from awareness of an issue to taking concrete steps toward resolving it.

## Why Is Time to Respond Important

A short response time demonstrates operational readiness and helps minimize the business impact of incidents. It reflects your team's ability to mobilize resources and begin addressing issues promptly, which is crucial for maintaining service reliability and customer trust.

## Example of Time to Respond

After acknowledging a website outage alert at 10:05 AM, the on-call engineer logs into the system, reviews error logs, and begins troubleshooting at 10:12 AM. The Time to Respond is 7 minutes, showing the team's readiness to address critical issues quickly.
