## What Is Time To Resolution

Time to Resolution, often called Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR), is the average time taken to completely fix an incident after it has been reported. It measures the duration from the initial report until the issue is resolved.

## Why Is Time To Resolution Important

This metric measures the efficiency of your incident response process. A lower Time to Resolution indicates faster recovery from disruptions. This minimizes downtime and impact on users.

## Example Of Time To Resolution

If three incidents took 4 hours, 6 hours, and 8 hours to resolve, the total time is 18 hours. The average Time to Resolution (MTTR) is 18 hours divided by 3 incidents, which equals 6 hours.
