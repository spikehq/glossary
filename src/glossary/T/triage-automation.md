## What Is Triage Automation

Triage automation is the use of AI and machine learning to automatically assess, categorize, and prioritize incoming incidents or alerts. It helps quickly determine the severity and urgency of issues, routing them to the appropriate teams or resources.

## Why Is Triage Automation Important

Triage automation significantly reduces response times and improves accuracy in incident handling. It helps teams focus on critical issues first, reduces alert fatigue, and ensures consistent application of triage criteria across all incidents.

## How To Implement Triage Automation

- Select an AI-powered incident management platform
- Define clear criteria for incident severity and priority
- Train the system using historical incident data
- Integrate with existing monitoring and alerting tools
- Continuously refine the automation rules based on feedback

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update triage criteria
- Maintain a human oversight mechanism for complex cases
- Use triage automation data to identify recurring issues
