## What Is Ticket Management

Ticket management is the overall process of handling incident tickets throughout their lifecycle. This includes creating, logging, categorizing, prioritizing, assigning, tracking, and closing tickets.

## Why Is Ticket Management Important

Effective ticket management streamlines the incident resolution process. It improves team coordination and provides visibility into support workload and performance. It helps resolve issues faster.

## Example Of Ticket Management

Using an IT Service Management (ITSM) tool to manage incoming support requests. The tool routes tickets based on issue type, assigns them to available staff, and tracks resolution time against service level agreements.

## How To Implement Ticket Management

- Define clear workflows for ticket handling, including escalation paths
- Train staff on using the system and following procedures
- Automate routine tasks like ticket assignment or status updates

## Best Practices

- Define clear priority levels and response time goals for tickets
- Regularly analyze ticket data to identify recurring problems or bottlenecks
- Integrate the ticketing system with monitoring tools for automatic ticket creation
