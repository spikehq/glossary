## What Is Threshold

A threshold is a predefined limit or boundary that, when crossed, triggers an alert or incident. In incident management, thresholds define the acceptable performance parameters for systems, applications, or services, helping teams identify abnormal conditions that require attention.

## Why Is Threshold Important

Well-defined thresholds help teams detect issues before they impact users. They provide an objective basis for determining when to create incidents and how to prioritize them. Appropriate thresholds reduce alert noise while ensuring genuine problems don't go unnoticed.

## Example Of Threshold

A web application has a response time threshold set at 2 seconds. When the average response time exceeds this value for 5 consecutive minutes, an alert is triggered. This allows the team to investigate performance degradation before users report problems.
