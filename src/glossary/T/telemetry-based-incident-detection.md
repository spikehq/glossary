## What Is Telemetry-Based Incident Detection

Telemetry-based incident detection uses real-time data collected from various systems and devices to identify potential security incidents. It involves monitoring and analyzing telemetry data to detect anomalies, patterns, or indicators of compromise that may signify a security threat.

## Why Is Telemetry-Based Incident Detection Important

This approach enables faster and more accurate incident detection by providing a comprehensive view of an organization's digital environment. It helps security teams identify threats that might otherwise go unnoticed, allowing for quicker response times and reduced impact of security incidents.

## Example of Telemetry-Based Incident Detection

A sudden spike in failed login attempts across multiple user accounts is detected through telemetry data. This anomaly triggers an alert, prompting the security team to investigate a potential brute-force attack.

## How to Implement Telemetry-Based Incident Detection

- Deploy sensors and collectors across your network and systems
- Establish baselines for normal behavior and performance
- Implement analytics tools to process and correlate telemetry data
- Set up alerting mechanisms for detected anomalies
- Integrate with incident response workflows for seamless handoff

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and update detection rules and thresholds
- Implement machine learning algorithms to improve detection accuracy over time
- Ensure proper data retention policies to support forensic analysis
