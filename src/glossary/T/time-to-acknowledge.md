## What Is Time to Acknowledge

Time to Acknowledge is the duration between when an incident alert is triggered and when a team member acknowledges receipt of that alert. This metric measures how quickly your incident response team notices and takes ownership of an issue after it's been detected by monitoring systems.

## Why Is Time to Acknowledge Important

Quick acknowledgment of incidents directly impacts your overall resolution time. Reducing this metric helps minimize system downtime and potential business impact. It also serves as an indicator of your team's alertness and the effectiveness of your notification systems.

## Example Of Time to Acknowledge

A critical database server goes down at 2:15 AM, triggering an alert. The on-call engineer receives the notification and acknowledges it at 2:18 AM, resulting in a 3-minute Time to Acknowledge. This prompt response allows the team to begin addressing the issue quickly, even during off-hours.
