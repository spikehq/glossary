## What Is Threat Management

Threat Management is the systematic process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating potential security threats to an organization's systems, data, and operations. It involves continuous monitoring, analysis of threat intelligence, implementation of preventive measures, and development of response strategies to address security incidents.

## Why Is Threat Management Important

Effective threat management reduces an organization's vulnerability to attacks and minimizes potential damage from security incidents. It helps organizations stay ahead of evolving threats, allocate security resources efficiently, and maintain business continuity. Proactive threat management can significantly reduce incident response costs and reputational damage.

## Example Of Threat Management

An organization's threat management team identifies a new phishing campaign targeting their industry. They quickly analyze the threat, update email filters, deploy additional monitoring, and send awareness communications to employees. When attempted phishing emails arrive, they're automatically blocked, and any user reports are quickly investigated.

## How To Implement Threat Management

- Establish a dedicated threat management function within security operations
- Implement tools for threat intelligence gathering and analysis
- Develop processes for threat prioritization and response
- Create integration points between threat management and incident response
- Build reporting mechanisms to track threat trends and mitigation effectiveness

## Best Practices

- Integrate threat intelligence from multiple sources for comprehensive awareness
- Develop automated responses for common threats to reduce response time
- Regularly review and update threat models based on emerging attack patterns
