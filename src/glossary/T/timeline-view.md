## What Is Timeline View

Timeline view is a visual representation of incident-related events in chronological order. It displays key actions, updates, and milestones throughout an incident's lifecycle, providing a clear overview of the incident management process.

## Why Is Timeline View Important

Timeline view offers a quick, comprehensive understanding of an incident's progression. It helps teams identify patterns, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement in the incident response process. This visual tool enhances communication and aids in post-incident analysis.

## Example Of Timeline View

A major e-commerce site experiences an outage. The timeline view shows:

- 10:00 AM: Initial alert received
- 10:05 AM: Incident created and assigned to on-call engineer
- 10:15 AM: Database issue identified as root cause
- 10:45 AM: Fix implemented and tested
- 11:00 AM: Service restored
- 11:30 AM: Incident closed

## How To Implement Timeline View

- Choose an incident management tool with timeline features
- Ensure all team members log their actions in real-time
- Integrate with monitoring and communication tools
- Use color-coding or icons to highlight critical events

## Best Practices

- Keep entries concise and relevant
- Update the timeline in real-time during active incidents
- Use the timeline for post-incident reviews and learning
