## What Is TEM (Threat and Error Management)

Threat and Error Management (TEM) is a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating potential threats and errors in operational environments. Originally developed for aviation safety, TEM has been adapted for use in cybersecurity incident management to improve overall system reliability and safety.

## Why Is TEM Important

TEM is important because it helps organizations anticipate and manage potential risks before they escalate into serious incidents. By focusing on both external threats and internal errors, TEM provides a comprehensive framework for maintaining operational safety and efficiency in complex, dynamic environments.

## Example of TEM

A security team uses TEM principles to identify potential vulnerabilities in their incident response process. They simulate various scenarios to uncover gaps in their procedures and develop strategies to address them before a real incident occurs.

## How to Implement TEM

- Conduct a thorough analysis of potential threats and errors in your environment
- Develop strategies to detect, avoid, and manage identified risks
- Train staff on TEM principles and practices
- Implement a reporting system for near-misses and potential issues
- Regularly review and update TEM procedures based on new insights and experiences

## Best Practices

- Foster a culture of open communication where team members feel comfortable reporting potential threats and errors
- Use data from past incidents to inform and improve TEM strategies
- Conduct regular simulations and exercises to test and refine TEM procedures
