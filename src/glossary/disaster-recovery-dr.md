## What Is Disaster Recovery (DR)

Disaster Recovery (DR) is a set of policies, tools, and procedures designed to help an organization recover IT systems and infrastructure after a major disruption or disaster. DR focuses on restoring critical systems to operational status following events like natural disasters, cyberattacks, or major hardware failures.

## Why Is Disaster Recovery Important

Disasters can strike without warning and potentially cripple an organization's ability to operate. A solid DR strategy minimizes downtime, protects critical data, and allows business operations to resume quickly. Without DR, organizations risk extended outages, data loss, and significant financial impact.

## Example Of Disaster Recovery

A regional power outage affects a company's primary data center. Their DR plan activates automatically, failing over critical applications to a secondary site in another region. Within 30 minutes, core business systems are operational again, allowing customer service to continue with minimal disruption.

## How To Implement Disaster Recovery

- Identify and prioritize critical systems and recovery objectives
- Develop detailed recovery procedures for different disaster scenarios
- Establish backup systems and redundant infrastructure
- Create clear roles and responsibilities for DR team members
- Test the DR plan regularly through simulations and drills

## Best Practices

- Define clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)
- Document DR procedures thoroughly so they can be followed under pressure
- Update the DR plan whenever systems or business requirements change
