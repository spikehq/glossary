## What Is Follow-Up Notification

A follow-up notification is a communication sent after an initial incident alert to provide updates on status, resolution progress, or additional information to stakeholders. These notifications keep everyone informed throughout the incident lifecycle without requiring constant manual updates.

## Why Is Follow-Up Notification Important

Follow-up notifications maintain transparency during incidents and reduce the need for stakeholders to request updates. They help teams focus on resolution rather than communication management. Regular updates also build trust with users and management by demonstrating active incident handling.

## Example Of Follow-Up Notification

During a network outage, the incident management system automatically sends updates every 30 minutes to affected teams. The first notification explains the issue and estimated resolution time. Subsequent notifications provide progress updates, and the final notification confirms resolution and includes a link to the incident report.
