## What Is Fault Tolerance

Fault tolerance is a system's ability to continue functioning properly when one or more of its components fail. In incident management, fault-tolerant systems maintain operations during hardware failures, software errors, or network issues, minimizing service disruptions and downtime.

## Why Is Fault Tolerance Important

Fault tolerance reduces service disruptions and prevents incidents from escalating into major outages. It helps maintain business continuity, protects revenue, and preserves user trust. For critical systems like healthcare or financial services, fault tolerance can prevent life-threatening or financially devastating failures.

## Example Of Fault Tolerance

A cloud service provider uses redundant servers across multiple data centers. When a power outage affects one data center, traffic automatically routes to servers in unaffected locations. Users experience no service interruption despite the significant infrastructure failure.

## How To Implement Fault Tolerance

- Build redundancy into critical systems and components
- Implement automatic failover mechanisms for seamless transitions
- Use load balancing to distribute traffic across multiple resources
- Create data backup and replication strategies
- Design systems with isolation zones to contain failures

## Best Practices

- Test fault tolerance mechanisms regularly through chaos engineering
- Document recovery procedures for different failure scenarios
- Balance fault tolerance investments against cost and complexity
