## What Is Feedback Loop

A feedback loop in incident management is a process where information about past incidents is collected, analyzed, and used to improve future incident response. It creates a continuous cycle of learning and improvement by turning incident outcomes into actionable insights for better system reliability.

## Why Is Feedback Loop Important

Feedback loops prevent teams from repeating the same mistakes by transforming incidents into learning opportunities. They help organizations build more resilient systems, reduce incident frequency, and improve response times. Without feedback loops, valuable lessons remain isolated and problems continue to recur.

## Example Of Feedback Loop

After a database outage, the incident response team identifies that monitoring alerts didn't trigger until users reported problems. The feedback loop prompts the team to implement earlier warning thresholds. During the next potential outage, these new alerts allow the team to address the issue before it impacts users.

## How To Create Feedback Loop

- Conduct thorough post-incident reviews with all stakeholders
- Document findings and recommendations in a centralized knowledge base
- Assign clear ownership for implementing improvements
- Schedule regular follow-ups to verify changes were made
- Measure the impact of improvements on incident metrics over time

## Best Practices

- Keep feedback loops short to implement improvements quickly
- Include both technical and process-related feedback
- Create a blameless culture where people feel safe sharing information
