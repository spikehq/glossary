## What Is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) is a discipline that incorporates aspects of software engineering and applies them to infrastructure and operations problems. SRE aims to create scalable and highly reliable software systems.

## Why Is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Important

SRE bridges the gap between development and operations, promoting a proactive approach to system reliability. It helps reduce downtime, improve incident response, and balance the pace of innovation with the risk of failure. SRE practices lead to more resilient systems and efficient incident management.
