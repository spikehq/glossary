## What Is Work Log

A work log is a chronological record of actions, decisions, and progress made during incident management. It captures key details about the incident handling process, serving as a valuable resource for analysis and improvement.

## Why Is Work Log Important

Work logs provide a clear audit trail of incident response activities. They help teams track progress, coordinate efforts, and facilitate post-incident reviews for continuous improvement.

## Example Of Work Log

During a server outage, the work log might include entries like:

- 10:15 AM: Alert received for server downtime
- 10:20 AM: Initial investigation started
- 10:35 AM: Root cause identified as failed hard drive
- 11:00 AM: Replacement drive installed
- 11:30 AM: Server back online, monitoring for stability
