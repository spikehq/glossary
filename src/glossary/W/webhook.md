## What Is Webhook

A webhook is an automated message sent from one application to another when a specific event occurs. In incident management, webhooks enable real-time notifications and integrations between different tools and systems.

## Why Is Webhook Important

Webhooks facilitate seamless information flow between incident management tools and other systems. They enable rapid notifications, automate workflows, and improve overall incident response efficiency.

## Example Of Webhook

When a critical incident is created in an incident management system, a webhook automatically triggers a notification in the team's chat application for immediate awareness.

## How To Implement Webhook

- Identify systems that need to communicate via webhooks
- Configure webhook endpoints in the receiving application
- Set up triggers for webhook dispatch in the sending application
- Test webhook functionality to ensure proper data transmission

## Best Practices

- Secure webhook endpoints with authentication mechanisms
- Implement retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- Use webhooks judiciously to avoid overwhelming systems
