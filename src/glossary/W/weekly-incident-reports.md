## What Is Weekly Incident Reports

Weekly Incident Reports are structured summaries that document all incidents that occurred within an organization over a seven-day period. These reports typically include incident statuses, threat levels, classification details, daily incident counts, and top trends to provide teams with visibility into their security and operational health.

## Why Is Weekly Incident Reports Important

Weekly Incident Reports help teams evaluate threats, measure response effectiveness, and identify emerging patterns. They create a regular cadence for reviewing incident data, making it easier to spot recurring issues before they become major problems. These reports also facilitate communication between technical teams and leadership about operational health.

## Example Of Weekly Incident Reports

A typical Weekly Incident Report might show that during the past week, an organization experienced 23 incidents: 15 closed, 5 open, and 3 snoozed. It would break down incidents by threat level (8 high, 10 medium, 5 low) and provide daily distribution data showing most incidents occurred on Wednesday. The report would highlight the top attackers, most targeted systems, and most common incident types.

## How To Implement Weekly Incident Reports

- Define what data points to track (status, severity, response times)
- Set up automated data collection from your incident management system
- Create a standardized template for consistency
- Schedule automatic report generation for Monday mornings
- Establish a review meeting with key stakeholders

## Best Practices

- Keep reports concise with visual elements like charts to highlight key trends
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative insights about notable incidents
- Compare current week data to previous weeks to identify trends

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Overwhelming reports with too much raw data instead of actionable insights
- Failing to distribute reports to all relevant stakeholders
- Not using the reports to drive process improvements
