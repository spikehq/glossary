## What Is Warning

A warning is an alert or notification issued to inform about a potential or imminent threat, risk, or problem. In incident management, it's a proactive measure to prevent or mitigate issues before they escalate into full-blown incidents.

## Why Is Warning Important

Warnings are crucial for early detection and prevention of incidents. They allow teams to take preemptive action, reducing the likelihood of service disruptions and minimizing potential damage or downtime.

## Example Of Warning

A server's CPU usage reaches 80%, triggering a warning alert. This prompts the IT team to investigate and address the issue before it leads to system slowdowns or crashes.
