## What Is Workflow Template

A workflow template is a pre-defined, reusable structure for managing specific types of incidents. It outlines the standard steps, required actions, communication points, and responsible roles. Templates provide a consistent starting point for incident response.

## Why Is Workflow Template Important

Templates promote consistency in handling similar incidents. They help teams follow established procedures, especially under pressure. They also speed up the incident setup process and reduce the chance of missing critical steps.

## Example Of Workflow Template

A 'Service Unresponsive' template might include:

- Step 1: Verify the outage via multiple monitoring tools
- Step 2: Assign severity and notify the incident commander
- Step 3: Escalate to the relevant service owner team
- Step 4: Post initial update to the status page
- Step 5: Schedule post-incident review task

## Types Of Workflow Template

- **Severity-based:** Different templates for P1 (high severity) versus P3 (low severity) incidents
- **Incident Type-based:** Specific templates for security incidents, database issues, or network outages
- **Service-based:** Unique templates for critical customer-facing services versus internal tools

## How To Create Workflow Template

- Identify common or critical types of incidents your team faces
- Document the standard operating procedure for handling each type
- Build these procedures into templates within your incident management tool
- Train responders on when and how to use different templates
- Regularly review and update templates based on postmortem findings

## Best Practices

- Keep templates focused and easy to understand
- Involve experienced responders and subject matter experts in template design
- Link templates to relevant documentation or runbooks

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Creating templates that are too rigid and don't allow for flexibility
- Forgetting to update templates when underlying processes or tools change
