## What Is War Room

A War Room is a dedicated space, physical or virtual, where teams gather to manage a major incident. It brings together subject matter experts and stakeholders to collaborate on resolving the issue quickly.

## Why Is War Room Important

War Rooms speed up communication and decision-making during critical incidents. They help teams coordinate effectively, reduce distractions, and adapt quickly as the situation evolves. Centralized communication also keeps stakeholders informed without disrupting responders.

## Example Of War Room

When a major website outage occurs, the company initiates a virtual War Room using a dedicated video conference bridge and Slack channel. Key engineers, operations staff, and communication leads join immediately to diagnose the problem, coordinate fixes, and plan customer updates.

## Types Of War Room

- **Physical War Room:** A designated conference room equipped for incident response. Less common with remote work
- **Virtual War Room:** Uses online tools like video conferencing, chat channels (Slack, Teams), or specialized incident management platforms
