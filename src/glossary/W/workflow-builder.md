## What Is Workflow Builder

Workflow Builder is a no-code/low-code tool that allows teams to create customized, automated incident response sequences. It enables users to design conditional triggers and actions that automatically orchestrate incident management processes, reducing manual work and standardizing response procedures across an organization.

## Why Is Workflow Builder Important

Workflow Builder reduces the manual effort required during incidents by automating routine tasks. It creates consistency in how incidents are handled, regardless of who's responding. By automating repetitive actions, teams can focus on complex problem-solving rather than coordination tasks, ultimately leading to faster resolution times.

## Example Of Workflow Builder

When a P1 (highest priority) incident is detected, a Workflow Builder might automatically: create a dedicated Slack channel, add the on-call engineer and incident commander, start a Zoom conference bridge, notify key stakeholders via SMS, and create a status page updateâ€”all within seconds of the incident being declared.

## Types Of Workflow Builder

- Trigger-based workflows that activate based on incident field values
- Manual workflows that responders can start from incident pages
- Time-based workflows that execute after specific time intervals
- Conditional workflows that branch based on incident attributes

## How To Create Workflow Builder

- Identify repetitive tasks in your incident response process
- Map out decision trees for different incident types and severities
- Create conditional logic using if-then statements
- Test workflows in a non-production environment
- Roll out gradually, starting with lower-priority incidents

## Best Practices

- Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity
- Document each workflow's purpose and expected outcomes
- Review and update workflows regularly based on effectiveness
