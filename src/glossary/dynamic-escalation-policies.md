## What Are Dynamic Escalation Policies

Dynamic escalation policies are flexible, context-aware rules that determine how and when incidents escalate to additional responders or teams. Unlike static policies, dynamic ones adapt based on incident severity, time of day, service impact, and responder availability.

## Why Are Dynamic Escalation Policies Important

Dynamic escalation policies prevent critical incidents from being overlooked or delayed. They adapt to changing circumstances, ensuring the right level of response at the right time. This reduces mean time to resolution and minimizes service impact during outages.

## Example Of Dynamic Escalation Policies

A critical payment service outage automatically escalates to senior engineers after 10 minutes without acknowledgment. During peak business hours, this escalation happens after just 5 minutes and includes notifying the CTO due to increased business impact.

## How To Implement Dynamic Escalation Policies With Spike

- Adjust escalation timeouts to make sure incidents move quickly to the next layer if unacknowledged.
- Use schedules to handle on-call rotation and automatic escalations without manual effort.
- Update policies anytime as your team's needs change.
