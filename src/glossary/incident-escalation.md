## What Is Incident Escalation

Incident escalation is the process of transferring an incident to higher levels of technical expertise or management authority when it cannot be resolved at the current level or requires additional attention due to its severity or impact.

## Why Is Incident Escalation Important

Effective escalation ensures incidents receive appropriate attention based on their impact and complexity. It prevents incidents from stalling, brings in specialized expertise when needed, and keeps stakeholders informed as situations develop. Proper escalation paths maintain accountability throughout the resolution process.

## Example Of Incident Escalation

A customer-facing payment system experiences intermittent failures. The first-level support team investigates but cannot identify the root cause after 30 minutes. Following the escalation procedure, they escalate to the payments engineering team who identifies a database connection issue and resolves it.
