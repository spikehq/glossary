## What Is Risk Analysis

Risk analysis in incident management is the systematic process of identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and their possible impacts on IT systems and services. It involves evaluating the likelihood and consequence of various incident scenarios to prioritize mitigation efforts.

## Why Is Risk Analysis Important

Risk analysis helps organizations allocate resources effectively by focusing on the most significant threats. It provides a foundation for proactive incident prevention rather than reactive response. This process also supports compliance requirements and builds organizational resilience.

## Example Of Risk Analysis

An e-commerce company analyzes their payment processing system and identifies several risks, including third-party service outages, database failures, and potential security breaches. They rate each risk based on probability and impact, determining that database failures pose the highest overall risk.

## How To Do Risk Analysis

- Identify critical assets and their dependencies
- Document potential threats and vulnerabilities
- Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk scenario
- Calculate risk scores to prioritize mitigation efforts
- Review and update analysis regularly as systems change

## Best Practices

- Involve cross-functional teams to capture diverse perspectives on risks
- Use both quantitative and qualitative methods for comprehensive analysis
- Focus on business impact rather than just technical considerations
