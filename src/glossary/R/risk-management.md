## What Is Risk Management

Risk management in incident management is the coordinated set of activities to direct and control an organization regarding risk. It involves identifying, assessing, and prioritizing risks followed by coordinated application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of incidents.

## Why Is Risk Management Important

Risk management reduces the frequency and severity of incidents through preventive measures. It helps organizations make informed decisions about acceptable risk levels and necessary controls. This discipline creates a more stable and predictable IT environment with fewer disruptive incidents.

## Example Of Risk Management

After identifying database failures as a high-risk area, an organization implements several controls: redundant database servers, automated backup systems, performance monitoring with early warning alerts, and regular maintenance procedures. These measures significantly reduce both the likelihood and potential impact of database-related incidents.

## How To Implement Risk Management

- Develop a risk management framework tailored to your organization
- Create risk registers to document and track identified risks
- Implement appropriate controls for high-priority risks
- Monitor the effectiveness of risk mitigation measures
- Integrate risk management into change management processes

## Best Practices

- Balance prevention, detection, and response capabilities
- Review and update risk assessments after significant incidents
- Establish clear ownership for risk management activities across the organization
