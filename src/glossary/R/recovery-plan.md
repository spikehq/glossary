## What Is Recovery Plan

A recovery plan is a documented set of procedures designed to restore systems and services after an incident. It outlines specific steps, resource requirements, and responsibilities to guide teams through the recovery process for different types of incidents.

## Why Is Recovery Plan Important

A recovery plan eliminates guesswork during high-pressure situations. It provides clear direction when teams are under stress, reduces recovery time, and helps maintain consistency in recovery efforts across different incidents and teams.

## Example Of Recovery Plan

A cloud service provider's recovery plan for network outages includes steps to identify affected segments, implement redundant pathways, verify service restoration, and communicate with customers. It specifies which team members handle each task and what tools they should use.

## How To Create Recovery Plan

- Identify critical systems and prioritize them for recovery
- Document step-by-step recovery procedures for each system
- Assign roles and responsibilities to team members
- Include communication templates and escalation paths
- Test and update the plan regularly

## Best Practices

- Keep recovery plans accessible during outages (including offline copies)
- Use clear, concise language that's easy to follow under pressure
- Review and update plans after major incidents or system changes
