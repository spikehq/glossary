## What Is Response Time

Response time in incident management is the duration between incident detection and the beginning of remediation efforts. It measures how quickly a team acknowledges and starts working on an incident after it's been identified or reported.

## Why Is Response Time Important

Fast response times limit incident impact and prevent problems from escalating. Quick responses demonstrate reliability to customers and stakeholders. This metric helps identify staffing gaps and process inefficiencies in the initial incident handling phase.

## Example Of Response Time

A monitoring system detects a website outage at 3:15 AM. The on-call engineer receives the alert, acknowledges it, and begins troubleshooting by 3:22 AM. The response time is 7 minutes, which falls within the organization's target of 15 minutes for critical incidents.
