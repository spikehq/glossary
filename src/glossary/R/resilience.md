## What Is Resilience In Incident Management

Resilience in incident management is the ability of an IT system or organization to withstand, adapt to, and rapidly recover from disruptions while maintaining continuous business operations. It involves designing systems that can absorb impacts, maintain core functionality during incidents, and return to normal operations quickly.

## Why Is Resilience Important In Incident Management

Resilience reduces business impact during incidents and helps maintain service continuity. It builds customer trust by minimizing downtime and preserving critical functions even when problems occur. Organizations with resilient systems face fewer catastrophic failures and recover faster when incidents do happen.
