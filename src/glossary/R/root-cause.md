## What Is Root Cause

Root cause is the fundamental, underlying reason for an incident or problem. It represents the core issue that, when addressed, prevents similar incidents from recurring. Root cause goes beyond symptoms to identify the original source of the failure.

## Why Is Root Cause Important

Identifying the root cause prevents treating only symptoms, which leads to recurring incidents. It enables permanent solutions rather than temporary fixes. Understanding root causes also helps organizations improve their systems and processes over time.

## Example Of Root Cause

A website experiences repeated outages. Initial investigation shows high server load (symptom). The root cause is identified as inefficient database queries triggered by a recent code change that weren't caught in testing.
