## What Are Real-time Alerts

Real-time alerts are immediate notifications triggered when monitoring systems detect anomalies, threshold violations, or potential incidents. These alerts notify responders about issues as they occur, enabling prompt investigation and response.

## Why Are Real-time Alerts Important

Real-time alerts minimize detection time for incidents, reducing overall impact and downtime. They allow teams to address issues before they affect users or critical business functions. Effective alerting is fundamental to proactive incident management.

## Example Of Real-time Alerts

A payment processing system sends real-time alerts when transaction success rates drop below 98%. This triggers an immediate investigation, allowing the team to identify and fix a failing API endpoint before most customers notice any issues.
