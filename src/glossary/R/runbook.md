## What Is Runbook

A runbook is a standardized document that contains step-by-step procedures for responding to specific incidents or performing routine operations. It provides clear instructions that guide responders through the process of diagnosing and resolving incidents efficiently.

## Why Is Runbook Important

Runbooks reduce response time and human error during incidents. They capture institutional knowledge, enable consistent responses regardless of who's on call, and help new team members respond effectively. Well-designed runbooks lead to faster incident resolution.

## Example Of Runbook

A database failure runbook includes steps to verify the outage, check for recent changes, review error logs, restart services in the correct order, verify recovery, and communicate with stakeholders throughout the process.
