## What Is Resolution Time

Resolution time is the total duration from when an incident is first detected until it is fully resolved and normal service is restored. It measures the complete lifecycle of an incident and reflects the efficiency of an organization's incident management process.

## Why Is Resolution Time Important

Resolution time directly impacts business operations and customer satisfaction. Shorter resolution times minimize service disruptions and associated costs. This metric helps identify bottlenecks in incident management processes and provides a benchmark for measuring improvement.

## Example Of Resolution Time

A critical database failure occurs at 2:00 PM. After detection, diagnosis, and implementation of a fix, normal operations resume at 4:30 PM. The resolution time is 2.5 hours, which can be compared against SLA targets and historical performance.
