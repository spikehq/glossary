## What Is Risk Register

A risk register is a document that records identified risks in incident management, their severity, likelihood of occurrence, potential impact, and mitigation strategies. It serves as a central repository for tracking and managing risks that could lead to incidents within an organization's systems or services.

## Why Is Risk Register Important

A risk register helps teams proactively identify and address potential issues before they cause incidents. It provides visibility into risk exposure, prioritizes mitigation efforts, and creates accountability for risk management. This proactive approach reduces the frequency and severity of incidents.

## Example Of Risk Register

A cloud service provider maintains a risk register that identifies "database server overload" as a high-risk item. The register documents the potential impact (service outage), likelihood (medium), current controls (load balancing), and additional mitigation plans (database scaling automation).

## How To Build Risk Register

- Create a standardized template for documenting risks
- Conduct regular risk identification sessions with cross-functional teams
- Assess each risk for likelihood and potential impact
- Develop mitigation strategies for high-priority risks
- Review and update the register regularly

## Best Practices

- Link risks directly to business impacts to help prioritization
- Assign clear ownership for each risk and its mitigation plan
- Review the register after major incidents to incorporate lessons learned
