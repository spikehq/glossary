## What Is Operational Intelligence

Operational intelligence is the real-time analysis of data from various sources to provide insights into business operations and incident management. It combines data analytics with business activity monitoring to improve decision-making and response times.

## Why Is Operational Intelligence Important

In incident management, operational intelligence helps teams make informed decisions quickly. It provides a comprehensive view of system health, user experience, and business impact, enabling faster and more effective incident resolution.

## Example of Operational Intelligence

An e-commerce platform uses operational intelligence to correlate website traffic, server performance, and order processing data. This allows them to quickly identify and address issues that could lead to lost sales or poor user experience.

## How to Implement Operational Intelligence

- Identify key data sources across your organization
- Implement real-time data collection and analysis tools
- Create dashboards that display relevant metrics and KPIs
- Integrate operational intelligence with incident management processes
- Train teams to use operational intelligence in their decision-making

## Best Practices

- Focus on actionable insights rather than just data collection
- Regularly review and update your operational intelligence strategy
- Use machine learning to enhance predictive capabilities
