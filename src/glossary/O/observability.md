## What Is Observability

Observability is the ability to understand a system's internal state based on its external outputs. It combines metrics, logs, and traces to provide insights into what's happening inside complex systems, making it easier to detect, investigate, and resolve incidents.

## Why Is Observability Important

Observability reduces mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) by providing context-rich data about system behavior. It helps teams understand not just that something is wrong, but why it's wrong, enabling faster and more accurate incident resolution.

## Example Of Observability

When a payment service experiences increased latency, an observability platform correlates this with recent code deployments, higher database query times, and increased error rates. This gives the incident team clear direction for investigation and resolution.
