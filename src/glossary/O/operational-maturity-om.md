## What Is Operational Maturity (OM)

Operational Maturity (OM) is a framework that measures how advanced an organization's operational practices and processes are in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and consistency. In incident management, it reflects how well a team can predict, prevent, detect, respond to, and learn from incidents.

## Why Is Operational Maturity Important

Higher operational maturity leads to fewer incidents, faster resolution times, and better service quality. It helps organizations move from reactive firefighting to proactive incident prevention. Teams with high OM experience less stress, lower costs, and improved customer satisfaction.

## Example Of Operational Maturity

A company progresses from manual incident detection and ad-hoc responses (low maturity) to automated monitoring, standardized playbooks, and regular process improvements based on incident data analysis (high maturity).
