## What Is On-Call Calendar

An on-call calendar is a visual representation of the on-call schedule that shows which team members are responsible for incident response during specific time periods. It integrates with personal and team calendars to provide clear visibility into on-call assignments, helping team members plan their personal and professional commitments accordingly.

## Why Is On-Call Calendar Important

On-call calendars provide transparency about who is responsible for incident response at any given time. They help team members plan around their on-call shifts and avoid scheduling conflicts. These calendars also serve as a quick reference during incidents, allowing teams to identify who should be contacted if additional support is needed.

## Example Of On-Call Calendar

A DevOps team uses an on-call calendar that syncs with their personal Google Calendars. When an engineer is scheduled for the upcoming weekend, they receive automatic notifications and can see their shift highlighted in their personal calendar. This visibility helps them plan personal activities around their on-call responsibilities.
