## What Is On-Call

On-call is a rotation system where IT professionals remain available outside regular working hours to respond to incidents and alerts. During their on-call shift, these professionals must be ready to address system issues, outages, or emergencies that require immediate attention to maintain service reliability.

## Why Is On-Call Important

On-call rotations provide continuous coverage for critical systems and services, preventing extended downtime and service disruptions. This 24/7 availability helps organizations meet SLAs, maintain customer trust, and minimize financial losses from unresolved incidents.

## Example Of On-Call

A DevOps engineer receives an alert at 2 AM about a database server crash. Being on-call, she acknowledges the alert through her incident management tool, investigates the issue remotely, and restores service within 30 minutes by restarting the database and fixing the configuration error.
