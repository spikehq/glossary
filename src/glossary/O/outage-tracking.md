## What Is Outage Tracking

Outage tracking is the systematic monitoring and documentation of service disruptions within an IT environment. It involves recording when services become unavailable, the duration of the outage, affected systems, impact severity, and resolution details.

## Why Is Outage Tracking Important

Outage tracking provides visibility into system reliability and helps teams identify recurring issues. It creates an audit trail for compliance purposes and supplies data for calculating important metrics like uptime percentages and mean time between failures. This data drives improvements in system design and incident response.

## Example Of Outage Tracking

A cloud service provider experiences a network outage affecting their east coast data center. Their outage tracking system automatically logs the start time, affected services, and customer impact. Engineers update the tracking record with investigation notes and resolution steps. After resolution, the system calculates the total downtime and adds it to historical reports.

## How To Implement Outage Tracking

- Deploy monitoring tools that can detect and log outages automatically
- Create a standardized format for documenting outage details
- Integrate outage tracking with incident management workflows
- Establish severity levels to categorize different types of outages
- Implement regular reporting and analysis of outage data

## Best Practices

- Make outage records accessible to all relevant stakeholders
- Include business impact assessments in your outage tracking
- Use outage data to identify patterns and drive preventative measures
