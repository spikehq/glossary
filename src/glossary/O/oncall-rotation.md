## What Is On-Call Rotation

On-call rotation is a system where team members take turns being available to respond to incidents outside regular working hours. This scheduled arrangement distributes responsibility for addressing urgent issues across the team, preventing burnout while maintaining continuous service availability. The on-call engineer must diagnose and fix problems ranging from system outages to security breaches.

## Why Is On-Call Rotation Important

On-call rotations provide immediate response to incidents outside business hours, significantly reducing downtime and maintaining service reliability. They distribute the workload evenly across team members, preventing burnout and promoting better work-life balance. This system also leads to continuous improvement as engineers gain valuable experience handling various incidents, building a more resilient incident response framework.

## Example Of On-Call Rotation

A software company implements a weekly rotation where each engineer takes turns being on-call. When a critical database failure occurs at 2 AM, the monitoring system alerts the on-call engineer through multiple channels. The engineer acknowledges the alert, diagnoses the issue, and restores service within 30 minutes, minimizing customer impact.
