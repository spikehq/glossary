## What Is Operational Resilience

Operational Resilience is an organization's ability to continue delivering critical services despite disruptive incidents. It combines risk management, business continuity, disaster recovery, and incident response to create systems that can absorb shocks, adapt to changing conditions, and recover quickly.

## Why Is Operational Resilience Important

Resilient operations maintain service availability during disruptions, protecting revenue and reputation. They reduce the business impact of incidents by limiting their scope and duration. Resilience also helps organizations meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations for reliable service.

## Example Of Operational Resilience

A financial services company experiences a data center outage but continues processing transactions by automatically failing over to a backup site. Their incident response team manages the situation while business operations continue with minimal customer impact.
