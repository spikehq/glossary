## What Is Outcome-Based Incident Management

Outcome-based incident management focuses on achieving specific, measurable results rather than just following predefined processes. It prioritizes the impact on business operations and user experience when handling incidents.

## Why Is Outcome-Based Incident Management Important

This approach ensures that incident response efforts align with business goals. It helps teams prioritize incidents based on their potential impact and focus on resolving the most critical issues first.

## Example of Outcome-Based Incident Management

A financial services company experiences a system outage. Instead of following a standard checklist, the team focuses on restoring core transaction processing capabilities first, minimizing financial impact and customer dissatisfaction.

## How to Implement Outcome-Based Incident Management

- Define clear, measurable outcomes for incident resolution
- Align incident response priorities with business objectives
- Implement flexible incident response procedures
- Train teams to focus on business impact rather than just technical fixes
- Regularly review and adjust your approach based on outcomes achieved

## Best Practices

- Develop a clear understanding of what constitutes a successful resolution
- Encourage creative problem-solving to achieve desired outcomes
- Regularly communicate the impact of incident management efforts to stakeholders
