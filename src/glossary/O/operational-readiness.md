## What Is Operational Readiness

Operational Readiness is the state of preparedness that allows an organization to effectively respond to and manage incidents when they occur. It encompasses having the right tools, processes, trained personnel, and resources in place to handle various incident scenarios.

## Why Is Operational Readiness Important

Being operationally ready minimizes the impact of incidents by reducing response time and improving resolution effectiveness. It helps organizations maintain service continuity during disruptions and builds confidence among stakeholders in the team's ability to handle crises.

## Example Of Operational Readiness

Before launching a major new feature, a software company conducts tabletop exercises simulating different failure scenarios. They verify that monitoring is in place, on-call schedules are set, and response playbooks are updated for potential incidents.
