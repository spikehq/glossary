## What Is Open Telemetry

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides standardized tools, APIs, and SDKs for collecting and exporting metrics, logs, and traces from applications and infrastructure. It helps create consistent observability data across diverse technology stacks.

## Why Is Open Telemetry Important

OpenTelemetry reduces vendor lock-in by providing a standard format for observability data. It simplifies instrumentation across heterogeneous environments and enables teams to switch between observability tools without changing their code. This flexibility improves incident detection and analysis capabilities.

## Example Of Open Telemetry

A company uses OpenTelemetry to instrument their microservices architecture. When an incident occurs, they can trace requests across multiple services, regardless of programming language or infrastructure, pinpointing exactly where failures happen.
