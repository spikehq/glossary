## What Is Queue

A queue in incident management is an organized list of incidents waiting to be addressed by support teams. It serves as a central repository where incidents are stored, prioritized, and assigned based on factors like severity, impact, and available resources.

## Why Is Queue Important

Queues create order in what could otherwise be chaos during multiple simultaneous incidents. They help teams prioritize their work based on business impact rather than just responding to the newest or loudest issues. Proper queue management prevents critical incidents from being overlooked.
