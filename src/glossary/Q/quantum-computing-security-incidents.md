## What Are Quantum Computing Security Incidents

Quantum computing security incidents are breaches or vulnerabilities that emerge from quantum computing technologies or target quantum systems. These incidents involve attacks that exploit quantum algorithms to break traditional encryption or compromise quantum communication channels, posing unique challenges for incident response teams.

## Example Of Quantum Computing Security Incidents

A theoretical quantum computing incident might involve an attacker using Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer to factor large prime numbers, breaking RSA encryption. This could compromise encrypted communications across an organization's network before traditional monitoring systems detect the breach.
