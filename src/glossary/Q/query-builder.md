## What Is Query Builder

Query Builder is a tool that allows users to create custom searches and filters for incident data without needing to know complex query languages. It provides a visual interface to construct searches across incident records, helping teams find relevant information quickly during incident management.

## Why Is Query Builder Important

Query Builder helps teams quickly find historical incidents similar to current ones, potentially revealing solutions. It supports post-incident analysis by making it easy to identify patterns across incidents. Teams can create custom views and reports without relying on technical specialists.

## Example Of Query Builder

A team lead needs to find all database-related incidents that occurred during peak hours in the last month. Using Query Builder, they select "Database" from the category dropdown, set a time range filter for business hours, and add a date range for the past 30 daysâ€”all without writing SQL.
