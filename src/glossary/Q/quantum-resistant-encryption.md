## What Is Quantum-resistant Encryption

Quantum-resistant encryption refers to cryptographic algorithms designed to withstand attacks from quantum computers. These encryption methods use mathematical problems that remain difficult to solve even with quantum computing power, protecting sensitive data against future quantum-based threats.

## Why Is Quantum-resistant Encryption Important

As quantum computing advances, traditional encryption methods like RSA and ECC will become vulnerable. Implementing quantum-resistant encryption helps organizations protect their data against future quantum attacks and prevents the need for emergency incident response when quantum computers become more powerful and accessible.

## How To Implement Quantum-resistant Encryption

- Inventory systems and data that rely on cryptographic protection
- Adopt NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography standards when available
- Implement crypto-agility to allow quick transitions between encryption algorithms
- Test quantum-resistant solutions in non-critical environments first
- Develop migration plans for critical systems with long-term security requirements

## Best Practices

- Stay informed about NIST's Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process
- Consider hybrid approaches that combine traditional and quantum-resistant algorithms during transition periods
- Include quantum-resistant encryption in your incident response planning for future-proofing
