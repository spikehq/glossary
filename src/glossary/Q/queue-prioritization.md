## What Is Queue Prioritization

Queue prioritization is a method used in incident management to organize and handle incoming incidents based on their urgency, impact, and business importance. It ensures critical issues receive attention first while less urgent matters wait in line, optimizing response resources and minimizing business disruption.

## Why Is Queue Prioritization Important

Queue prioritization prevents critical incidents from being buried under less important issues. It helps teams focus their efforts where they matter most, reduces overall business impact, and creates a structured approach to incident handling. Without proper prioritization, teams risk addressing minor problems while major outages remain unresolved.

## Example Of Queue Prioritization

A cloud service provider receives multiple incident reports simultaneously. Their queue prioritization system automatically flags a database outage affecting thousands of customers as P1 (highest priority), while routing a minor UI glitch to a lower priority queue for later resolution.

## How To Do Queue Prioritization

- Define clear priority levels based on impact, urgency, and business value
- Create automated rules to assign initial priority scores to incoming incidents
- Establish escalation paths for incidents that need priority adjustment
- Train responders to understand and apply prioritization criteria consistently
- Implement a system that visually distinguishes between priority levels

## Best Practices

- Regularly review and adjust prioritization criteria based on changing business needs
- Include both automated and human judgment in the prioritization process
- Document the reasoning behind priority decisions for future reference and continuous improvement
