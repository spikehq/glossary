## What Is Alert Noise

Alert noise refers to the excessive, often irrelevant notifications generated by monitoring systems that don't require immediate action. It includes duplicate alerts, false positives, and low-priority notifications that distract teams from addressing genuine incidents.

## Example Of Alert Noise

A monitoring system sends 50 separate alerts when a server experiences high CPU usage, network latency, and memory pressure—all stemming from the same root cause. This flood of notifications makes it difficult for the on-call engineer to identify and address the actual problem.

## How To Reduce Alert Noise With Spike

- Spike automatically rate-limits duplicate incidents to just 1 per minute, cutting down excessive notifications.
- The platform suppresses duplicate incidents while ensuring you never miss the initial alert.
- Spike intelligently parses incident payloads into human-readable formats to identify and manage duplicates.
- You'll receive admin email notifications when rate limiting is applied, keeping you informed without overwhelming you.
- Rate limiting applies only to specific duplicate incidents, not entire integrations, so critical unique alerts still come through.
