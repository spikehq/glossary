## What Is Anticipatory Incident Management

Anticipatory Incident Management is a forward-looking approach that uses predictive analytics, historical patterns, and contextual awareness to identify and address potential incidents before they occur. It shifts incident management from reactive to proactive by anticipating problems rather than waiting for them to happen.

## Why Is Anticipatory Incident Management Important

Preventing incidents is always better than resolving them after impact. Anticipatory management reduces downtime, preserves user experience, and lowers the operational cost of incidents. It also decreases responder stress and burnout by converting urgent firefighting into planned preventive work.

## Example Of Anticipatory Incident Management

A retail company's incident management system analyzes three years of historical data and identifies that database performance issues typically occur during the first weekend of each month's sales promotion. The team proactively scales database resources before the upcoming promotion, preventing the anticipated incident entirely.

## How To Implement Anticipatory Incident Management

- Build a knowledge base of historical incidents and their precursors
- Deploy predictive analytics to identify patterns and leading indicators
- Create automated early warning systems for common incident types
- Develop playbooks for preemptive actions when warnings occur
- Establish processes to validate and improve predictions over time
