## What Are Joint AI-human Response Teams

Joint AI-Human Response Teams are groups where artificial intelligence systems and human experts collaborate directly to manage and resolve incidents. AI handles data processing and automation, while humans provide oversight, strategy, and complex problem-solving.

## Why Are Joint AI-human Response Teams Important

This approach combines AI's speed in analyzing vast data and automating tasks with human intuition, experience, and strategic decision-making. It leads to faster detection, more accurate diagnosis, and quicker resolution times.

## Example Of Joint AI-human Response Teams

An AI system detects an unusual pattern and alerts the human team with context and suggested actions. A human analyst validates the alert, uses AI-provided data for diagnosis, and approves or modifies the AI's recommended remediation step.

## How To Build Joint AI-human Response Teams

- Integrate AI tools into the incident management workflow
- Clearly define roles and responsibilities for both AI and human team members
- Establish protocols for how humans review and act on AI suggestions
- Implement feedback loops for humans to train and improve AI performance
- Use AI for tasks like alert correlation, automated triage, and suggesting root causes

## Best Practices

- Start with AI augmenting specific tasks, not full replacement
- Build trust by making AI decision-making processes transparent
- Train humans on how to effectively collaborate with AI tools

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Over-reliance on AI without sufficient human oversight
- Lack of clear communication protocols between AI and human responders
- Using AI tools in silos, not integrated into the team's workflow

## KPIs For Joint AI-human Response Teams

- Reduction in Mean Time To Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time To Resolve (MTTR)
- Improvement in threat detection accuracy
- Reduction in false-positive alerts escalated to humans
