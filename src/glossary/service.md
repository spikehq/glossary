## What Is Service

A service in incident management refers to any application, system, or infrastructure component that delivers value to users. Services can include customer-facing applications, internal tools, APIs, databases, or network infrastructure that support business operations.

## Example Of Service

An e-commerce company identifies their checkout process as a critical service. This service depends on payment processing, inventory management, and user authentication components. When an incident affects any of these components, the impact on the checkout service determines response priority.
