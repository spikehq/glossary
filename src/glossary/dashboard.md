## What Is Dashboard

A dashboard is a visual display that presents critical incident management data in real-time. It consolidates key metrics, alerts, and statuses into a single interface, allowing teams to monitor system health, track ongoing incidents, and measure performance at a glance.

## Why Is Dashboard Important

Dashboards provide immediate visibility into your operational status, helping teams detect and respond to incidents faster. They transform complex data into actionable insights, facilitate better decision-making during critical situations, and keep all stakeholders informed with consistent, up-to-date information.
