## What Is User Impact

User impact is the measure of how an incident affects end users' ability to access services, perform tasks, or achieve their goals. It quantifies the scope and severity of disruption caused by an incident, including the number of users affected and the criticality of impacted functions.

## Importance Of User Impact

User impact helps prioritize incident response efforts based on business criticality. It provides context for resource allocation, communication urgency, and resolution timeframes. Understanding user impact allows teams to focus on incidents that matter most to the organization's operations and customers.

## Example Of User Impact

A payment processing system failure during Black Friday affects thousands of customers trying to complete purchases. The high user impact (both in number of users and revenue implications) makes this incident a top priority requiring immediate attention and resources.

## How To Implement User Impact Assessment

- Define clear criteria for measuring impact (users affected, business functions disrupted)
- Create a standardized scale for categorizing impact levels
- Implement monitoring tools that can quantify affected users in real-time
- Establish thresholds that trigger different response levels based on impact
- Integrate user impact assessment into incident management workflows

## Best Practices

- Consider both quantitative (number of users) and qualitative (criticality of function) factors
- Regularly review and update impact assessment criteria as business needs evolve
- Collect feedback from affected users to validate impact assessments and improve future responses
