## What Is Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum acceptable time it should take to restore a system after an incident. It defines how quickly a business process must be restored to avoid unacceptable consequences from a break in continuity.

## Why Is Recovery Time Objective (RTO) Important

RTO guides investment in recovery capabilities and helps set realistic expectations with stakeholders. It ensures that recovery strategies align with business needs and helps incident teams prioritize their efforts during restoration activities.

## Example Of Recovery Time Objective (RTO)

An e-commerce platform sets an RTO of 15 minutes for its payment processing system. This drives their investment in redundant payment infrastructure, automated failover mechanisms, and dedicated recovery teams to meet this tight timeline.
