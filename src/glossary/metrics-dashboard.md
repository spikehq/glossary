## What Is Metrics Dashboard

A Metrics Dashboard is a visual interface that displays key incident management performance indicators in real-time, allowing teams to monitor system health, track incident response effectiveness, and identify trends at a glance.

## Why Is Metrics Dashboard Important

Metrics Dashboards provide immediate visibility into system performance and incident status. They help teams quickly identify issues before they escalate, support data-driven decisions during incidents, and enable continuous improvement through performance tracking over time.

## Example Of Metrics Dashboard

An IT operations team uses a dashboard showing current incident count by severity, average resolution time, and service health across all systems. When multiple incidents appear for the authentication service, they immediately investigate before users report problems.

## How To Build Metrics Dashboard

- Identify the most critical metrics for your incident management process
- Select visualization tools that support real-time data updates
- Design layouts that highlight important information without overwhelming viewers
- Integrate with your incident management and monitoring systems
- Create different views for various stakeholders and purposes

## Best Practices

- Focus on actionable metrics rather than vanity metrics
- Use color coding and visual cues to highlight critical issues
- Keep dashboards simple and relevant to their intended audience
