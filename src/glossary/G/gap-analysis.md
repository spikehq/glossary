## What Is Gap Analysis

Gap Analysis in incident management is a systematic process that compares current incident response capabilities against desired or required standards. It identifies shortfalls in tools, processes, personnel, or skills that prevent an organization from handling incidents effectively.

## Why Is Gap Analysis Important

Gap Analysis helps organizations identify weaknesses in their incident management framework before they lead to failed responses. It provides a clear roadmap for improvement, prioritizes resource allocation, and helps meet compliance requirements by highlighting areas that fall short of industry standards.

## Example Of Gap Analysis

A healthcare organization analyzes its incident response capabilities and discovers a 15-minute delay between alert generation and team notification. This gap could be critical during patient-impacting incidents, prompting them to implement an automated alert system that reduces notification time to under 2 minutes.

## How To Implement Gap Analysis

- Document your current incident management processes and capabilities
- Define the desired state based on industry standards and business needs
- Identify discrepancies between current and desired states
- Prioritize gaps based on risk and impact
- Develop an action plan to address the most critical gaps

## Best Practices

- Involve representatives from all teams that participate in incident response
- Conduct gap analysis regularly, not just after major incidents
- Focus on both technical and human aspects of incident management
