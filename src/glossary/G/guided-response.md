## What Is Guided Response

Guided Response is a structured approach to incident management that provides step-by-step instructions for responders to follow during specific types of incidents. It uses predefined playbooks or automated workflows to standardize incident handling.

## Why Is Guided Response Important

Guided Response reduces human error during high-stress situations. It speeds up incident resolution by eliminating guesswork, creates consistency across different responders, and helps less experienced team members handle complex incidents effectively.

## Example Of Guided Response

When a database outage occurs, the on-call engineer receives an automated alert with a guided response playbook. The playbook walks them through checking connection issues, verifying recent changes, running diagnostic queries, and executing recovery procedures in a specific sequence.

## How To Implement Guided Response

- Identify common incident types that would benefit from standardized responses
- Document step-by-step procedures for each incident type
- Create decision trees for scenarios with multiple possible causes
- Integrate playbooks into your incident management platform
- Test playbooks regularly through simulations

## Best Practices

- Keep playbooks concise and focused on actions rather than explanations
- Include verification steps to confirm each action was successful
- Update playbooks after incidents to incorporate lessons learned
