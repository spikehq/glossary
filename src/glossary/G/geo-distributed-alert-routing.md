## What Is Geo-distributed Alert Routing

Geo-distributed Alert Routing is a system that directs incident alerts to appropriate responders based on geographic location. It considers factors like time zones, regional expertise, and local infrastructure to route notifications to the most suitable team members.

## Why Is Geo-distributed Alert Routing Important

This routing method prevents alert fatigue by sending notifications only to relevant regional teams. It improves response times by matching incidents with nearby responders who understand local systems. For global organizations, it enables follow-the-sun support models and helps balance workload across different regions.

## Example Of Geo-distributed Alert Routing

When a server fails in Singapore, the alert system automatically notifies the APAC support team instead of waking up engineers in Europe. The system recognizes the incident location and routes it to on-call staff in the same region who have the context and access needed for faster resolution.

## How To Implement Geo-distributed Alert Routing

- Map your infrastructure and services to geographic regions
- Define regional teams and their areas of responsibility
- Configure routing rules in your incident management platform
- Set up escalation paths that cross regions when needed
- Test the routing logic with simulated alerts from different locations

## Best Practices

- Include language skills and regional expertise in routing decisions
- Create overlap periods during shift changes between regions
- Review routing effectiveness regularly and adjust based on resolution metrics
