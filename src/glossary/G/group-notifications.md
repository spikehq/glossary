## What Are Group Notifications

Group Notifications are alert messages sent simultaneously to multiple team members during an incident. These coordinated communications keep relevant stakeholders informed about incident status, required actions, and resolution progress through various channels like email, SMS, or mobile apps.

## Why Are Group Notifications Important

Group Notifications create shared awareness during incidents and reduce communication overhead. They eliminate the need to manually contact each stakeholder and ensure everyone receives consistent information. This approach speeds up response by quickly assembling the right people and keeps management informed without disrupting the technical response.

## Example Of Group Notifications

When a critical payment system fails, the incident management platform automatically sends alerts to the primary response team via phone calls. Simultaneously, it notifies secondary support teams via SMS and sends status updates to management through email. Each group receives information tailored to their role in the incident response.

## How To Implement Group Notifications

- Define notification groups based on roles and responsibilities
- Configure different message formats for various communication channels
- Set up escalation rules for unanswered notifications
- Create templates for common incident types to speed up communication
- Implement acknowledgment tracking to confirm receipt of critical alerts

## Best Practices

- Tailor notification content to each group's needs and technical knowledge
- Use different urgency levels and channels based on incident severity
- Include clear action items or expectations in each notification
