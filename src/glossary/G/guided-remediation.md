## What Is Guided Remediation

Guided Remediation is a structured approach to incident resolution that provides responders with step-by-step instructions for addressing specific types of incidents. It combines predefined workflows with contextual information to guide teams through the troubleshooting and resolution process.

## Why Is Guided Remediation Important

Guided Remediation reduces human error during stressful incidents and standardizes response quality across different team members. It shortens resolution times by eliminating guesswork and helps less experienced staff resolve complex issues. This approach also creates a knowledge base of proven solutions that improves over time.

## Example Of Guided Remediation

When a database performance alert triggers, the on-call engineer receives a notification with a guided workflow. The system shows previous similar incidents, suggests checking specific metrics, and provides commands to run. Each step includes expected outcomes and alternative paths based on findings, guiding the engineer to a faster resolution.

## How To Implement Guided Remediation

- Document common incident types and their proven resolution steps
- Build templates that include diagnostic commands and decision trees
- Integrate remediation guides with your incident management platform
- Update guides based on post-incident reviews and new learnings
- Automate parts of the remediation process where possible

## Best Practices

- Keep instructions clear and concise for high-stress situations
- Include verification steps to confirm successful resolution
- Allow for deviation from guides when necessary, but document why
