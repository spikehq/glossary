## What Is Global Incident Response Team

A Global Incident Response Team is a distributed group of specialists who manage incidents across different geographic regions and time zones. They provide 24/7 coverage for incident detection, triage, and resolution on a worldwide scale.

## Why Is Global Incident Response Team Important

Global Incident Response Teams provide continuous coverage without burnout. They offer localized expertise for region-specific issues, enable follow-the-sun support models, and maintain consistent incident management practices across international operations.

## Example Of Global Incident Response Team

A multinational financial services company maintains incident response teams in Singapore, London, and New York. When a critical payment system fails, the Singapore team begins troubleshooting, documents their progress, and hands off to London as their workday ends. London continues the work and later transfers to New York, ensuring 24-hour response without any single team working overtime.

## How To Build Global Incident Response Team

- Establish regional teams with overlapping working hours
- Create standardized handoff procedures between regions
- Implement shared tools and documentation platforms
- Define escalation paths that work across time zones
- Develop common training and certification requirements

## Best Practices

- Hold regular cross-region meetings to build relationships
- Maintain a unified incident management platform accessible to all teams
- Create clear documentation standards that transcend language and cultural differences
