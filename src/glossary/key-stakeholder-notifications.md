## What Are Key Stakeholder Notifications

Key Stakeholder Notifications are targeted communications sent to important individuals during an incident. These individuals can be internal (like executives) or external (like major clients) who need awareness about the incident's status and impact.

## Why Are Key Stakeholder Notifications Important

These notifications keep crucial people informed without them needing to chase responders for updates. This reduces interruptions for the technical teams and helps business leaders make informed decisions during disruptions. Clear communication minimizes confusion and manages expectations.

## Example Of Key Stakeholder Notifications

During a critical service outage, automated emails are sent every hour to department heads and the executive team. The emails summarize the business impact, current status, and estimated time to resolution. Another example is an SMS alert sent to the CTO when a P1 incident is declared.

## Types Of Key Stakeholder Notifications

- **Email notifications** for formal documentation
- **Chat messages (Slack, Teams)** for real-time updates
- **Phone calls** for urgent coordination
- **Status dashboard updates** for visual tracking

## How To Implement Key Stakeholder Notifications

- Identify key stakeholders for different services or incident types
- Define triggers, frequency, channels, and content for notifications
- Create communication templates for consistency
- Use incident management tools to automate notifications where possible

## Best Practices

- Tailor the message content and technical detail to the specific stakeholder group
- Automate notifications to save time and reduce manual effort
- Stick to a predefined communication schedule during major incidents

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Relying solely on manual processes, which delays updates
- Sending inconsistent or conflicting messages across different channels
- Failing to notify stakeholders promptly or frequently enough
