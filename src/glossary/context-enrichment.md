## What Is Context Enrichment

Context enrichment is the process of adding relevant information to incident alerts, providing responders with a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. It combines data from various sources to give a clearer picture of the incident's impact and potential causes.

## Why Is Context Enrichment Important

Context enrichment speeds up incident resolution by giving responders immediate access to crucial information. It reduces the time spent gathering data, allows for more informed decision-making, and helps prioritize incidents based on their potential impact.

## Example Of Context Enrichment

An alert for a server outage is enriched with information about the server's location, current workload, recent changes, and affected services. This additional context helps the response team quickly assess the situation and take appropriate action.
