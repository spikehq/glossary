## What Is Virtual War Room

A virtual war room is an online collaborative space where incident responders and stakeholders gather to work through major incidents. It serves as a centralized hub for communication, coordination, and problem-solving during critical situations, allowing teams to collaborate regardless of physical location.

## Why Is Virtual War Room Important

Virtual war rooms bring together experts from different teams to focus solely on resolving critical incidents. They facilitate quick communication, eliminate distractions, and allow teams to adapt as incidents evolve. This collaborative approach increases the chances of finding effective solutions and reduces resolution time.

## Example Of Virtual War Room

When a major service outage occurs, the incident commander creates a dedicated video conference and chat channel. System engineers, developers, and network specialists join the virtual war room to share information, discuss potential causes, and coordinate their response efforts. Stakeholders receive regular updates without interrupting the technical work.
