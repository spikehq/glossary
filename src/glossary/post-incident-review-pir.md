## What Is Post-Incident Review (PIR)

A Post-Incident Review (PIR) is a structured analysis conducted after an incident has been resolved to understand what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent similar incidents in the future. It examines the incident timeline, response effectiveness, root causes, and identifies actionable improvements.

## Why Is Post-Incident Review Important

Post-Incident Reviews transform incidents from purely negative events into valuable learning opportunities. They help organizations improve their incident response processes, prevent recurring issues, and build institutional knowledge. PIRs foster a culture of continuous improvement and accountability without blame.

## Example Of Post-Incident Review

Following a two-hour service outage, a team conducts a PIR and discovers that the incident was caused by an unapproved configuration change. They trace the root cause to unclear change management procedures and lack of automated validation checks. The review results in specific process improvements and new automated safeguards.
