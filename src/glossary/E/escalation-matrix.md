## What Is Escalation Matrix

An escalation matrix is a visual representation of the escalation policy, showing who to contact at each level of escalation for different types of incidents.

## Why Is Escalation Matrix Important

An escalation matrix provides clarity and quick reference during high-stress incidents. It speeds up decision-making and ensures that the right people are involved at the right time.

## Example Of Escalation Matrix

A table showing incident types (network, database, application) on one axis and escalation levels (L1, L2, L3, Management) on the other, with specific team members or roles listed in each cell.

## How to Create Escalation Matrix

- Identify all possible incident types and severity levels
- Define escalation levels and associated roles
- Create a clear, easy-to-read matrix document
- Distribute the matrix to all relevant team members
- Integrate the matrix into your incident management tools

## Best Practices

- Keep the matrix up-to-date with current contact information
- Make the matrix easily accessible during incidents
- Include backup contacts for each role in the matrix
