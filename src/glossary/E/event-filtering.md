## What Is Event Filtering

Event filtering is a process in incident management that selects or excludes specific events based on predefined criteria. It helps reduce noise and focus on relevant information, allowing teams to prioritize and respond to critical incidents more effectively.

## Why Is Event Filtering Important

Event filtering prevents information overload by reducing the volume of non-critical alerts. It helps incident response teams focus on significant events, improves response times, and reduces alert fatigue among team members.

## Example Of Event Filtering

A monitoring system generates alerts for all server CPU usage spikes. Event filtering is applied to only show alerts when CPU usage exceeds 90% for more than 5 minutes, reducing unnecessary notifications.

## How To Implement Event Filtering

- Define clear criteria for critical events
- Configure monitoring tools with appropriate thresholds
- Set up rules to categorize and prioritize events
- Regularly review and adjust filtering rules

## Best Practices

- Align filtering criteria with business priorities
- Use a tiered approach to filter events by severity
- Regularly audit filtered events to ensure critical issues aren't missed
