## What Is Event

An event is any observable occurrence in an IT system or business process that may require attention. Events include system alerts, log entries, monitoring notifications, or user reports. Not all events are incidentsâ€”they only become incidents when they impact service or violate service level agreements.

## Why Is Event Important

Events provide the raw data needed to detect and diagnose incidents. Proper event monitoring allows teams to identify potential issues before they impact users. Events also create an audit trail that helps with post-incident analysis and pattern recognition.

## Example Of Event

A server generates an event when its CPU utilization exceeds 90% for five minutes. This event triggers an alert to the operations team, who investigate whether this performance issue might affect service delivery or requires intervention.
