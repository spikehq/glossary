## What Is Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB)

An Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) is a smaller, more accessible version of the standard Change Advisory Board that convenes quickly to assess and approve emergency changes. The ECAB typically consists of key decision-makers who can be reached 24/7 to evaluate high-priority changes that cannot wait for regular CAB meetings.

## Why Is Emergency Change Advisory Board (ECAB) Important

The ECAB provides governance and oversight for emergency changes while maintaining the agility needed during critical incidents. It balances the need for quick action with appropriate risk assessment, preventing rash decisions while still enabling rapid response to urgent situations.
