## What Is Event Review

Event review is the process of analyzing recorded events to gain insights, identify patterns, and improve incident management processes. It involves examining event records, discussing significant incidents, and developing action plans for future improvements.

## Why Is Event Review Important

Event reviews help organizations learn from past incidents, refine their response strategies, and prevent recurring issues. They support continuous improvement in incident management and contribute to overall system reliability.

## Example Of Event Review

A monthly event review reveals that 70% of critical incidents were related to a specific application. This insight leads to a focused investigation and subsequent upgrade of the problematic application.

## How To Do Event Review

- Prepare summaries of significant events for discussion
- Involve key stakeholders from different teams
- Analyze trends and patterns in event data
- Develop action plans based on review findings

## Best Practices

- Focus on learning and improvement rather than blame
