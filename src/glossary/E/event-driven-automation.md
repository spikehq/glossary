## What Is Event-Driven Automation

Event-Driven Automation is an approach to incident management where system events automatically trigger predefined response actions without human intervention. It uses a series of if-this-then-that rules to execute remediation steps immediately when specific conditions are detected.

## Why Is Event-Driven Automation Important

Event-Driven Automation dramatically reduces response times by eliminating the delay between detection and initial response. It handles routine incidents consistently, frees up human responders for complex problems, and scales incident management capabilities without proportionally increasing staff.

## Example Of Event-Driven Automation

When a database server reaches 90% disk capacity, an automated workflow launches that identifies and removes temporary files, archives old logs, and expands storage if needed. This resolves the issue before it causes application errors, often without any human involvement.

## How To Implement Event-Driven Automation

- Map common incidents to potential automated responses
- Create a library of tested remediation scripts
- Implement a rules engine to match events with appropriate actions
- Start with low-risk automations and gradually expand
- Build in safety mechanisms and human approval steps for critical systems

## Best Practices

- Always include monitoring for the automation itself
- Design automations to fail safely and notify humans when uncertain
- Document all automated processes thoroughly for transparency
