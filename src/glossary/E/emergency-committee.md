## What Is Emergency Committee

An Emergency Committee is a cross-functional team responsible for managing organizational response during major incidents or crises. This committee makes critical decisions, coordinates resources, and oversees communication during emergencies that affect business operations, safety, or reputation.

## Why Is Emergency Committee Important

Emergency Committees provide clear leadership and decision-making authority during crises when normal operations are disrupted. They bring together expertise from across the organization to address complex incidents, coordinate response efforts, and minimize impact on business operations and stakeholders.

## How To Build Emergency Committee

- Appoint members representing IT, security, legal, communications, and business units
- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each committee member
- Establish activation thresholds and notification procedures
- Create decision-making frameworks for common emergency scenarios
- Conduct regular training exercises to prepare the committee
