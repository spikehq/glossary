## What Is Elastic Incident Response Teams

Elastic Incident Response Teams are flexible groups that expand or contract based on incident severity and needs. This model moves beyond fixed team structures to dynamically pull in the right expertise when needed and release resources when they're no longer required.

## Why Is Elastic Incident Response Teams Important

Traditional fixed teams often struggle with incident surges or specialized issues. The elastic approach matches resources to actual needs, preventing both understaffing during major incidents and wasted capacity during quiet periods. It also brings diverse expertise to complex problems.

## Example Of Elastic Incident Response Teams

A software company maintains a core incident response team of five people. When a critical authentication service fails, the team automatically expands to include security specialists, database experts, and customer support leads. As components are restored, team members return to their regular duties.

## How To Build Elastic Incident Response Teams

- Define clear criteria for team expansion and contraction
- Create a skills matrix identifying expertise across the organization
- Establish on-call rotations for specialists outside the core team
- Implement communication protocols that scale with team size
- Develop role-specific playbooks for occasional responders

## Best Practices

- Conduct regular cross-training to increase flexibility
- Practice expanding teams during simulated incidents
- Maintain clear command structures even as teams grow
