## What Is External Status Page

An external status page is a public-facing webpage that communicates the operational status of an organization's services to customers, users, and other stakeholders. It displays real-time information about ongoing incidents, planned maintenance, and service health.

## Why Is External Status Page Important

External status pages build trust through transparency when incidents occur. They reduce support volume by proactively informing users about known issues. Status pages also demonstrate accountability and provide a single source of truth during outages, preventing misinformation.

## Example Of External Status Page

During a major cloud service disruption, a company's status page shows which specific services are affected, when the issue was first detected, what steps are being taken to resolve it, and the estimated time to resolution. Users can subscribe to updates and see the incident history.
