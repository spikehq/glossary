## What Is Escalation Policy

An escalation policy is a predefined set of rules that determine how and when to elevate an incident to higher levels of support or management. It ensures timely resolution of critical issues.

## Why Is Escalation Policy Important

A well-defined escalation policy prevents incidents from falling through the cracks. It clarifies responsibilities, reduces response times, and ensures that critical issues receive appropriate attention.

## Example Of Escalation Policy

If a critical system outage isn't resolved within 30 minutes, the policy might dictate escalating the incident to the senior engineering team and notifying the CTO.

## How To Create Escalation Policy With Spike
