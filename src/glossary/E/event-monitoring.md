## What Is Event Monitoring

Event monitoring is the continuous observation of IT systems and applications to detect and log events that may affect performance, availability, or security. It forms the foundation of effective incident management by providing real-time insights into system health.

## Why Is Event Monitoring Important

Event monitoring enables early detection of potential issues, allowing teams to address problems before they escalate. It supports proactive maintenance, helps maintain service level agreements, and provides valuable data for trend analysis.

## Example Of Event Monitoring

A database server's memory usage is continuously monitored. When it reaches 80% capacity, an alert is triggered, allowing the IT team to investigate and prevent potential performance issues.

## How To Implement Event Monitoring

- Identify critical systems and key performance indicators
- Deploy monitoring tools across the IT infrastructure
- Set up alerts and notifications for significant events
- Establish a centralized monitoring dashboard
- Train staff on interpreting monitoring data

## Best Practices

- Use a mix of agent-based and agentless monitoring techniques
- Implement real-time visualization of monitoring data
- Regularly review and update monitoring thresholds
