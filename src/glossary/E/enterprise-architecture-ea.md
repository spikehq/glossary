## What Is Enterprise Architecture (EA)

Enterprise Architecture (EA) is a strategic framework that aligns an organization's IT infrastructure with its business goals and processes. In incident management, EA provides a comprehensive view of systems, applications, and their interdependencies, helping teams understand the potential impact of incidents across the organization.

## Why Is Enterprise Architecture (EA) Important

EA gives incident responders crucial context about how systems connect and depend on each other. When incidents occur, this architectural understanding helps teams quickly identify affected services, assess business impact, and prioritize response efforts. It also supports better root cause analysis by mapping relationships between components.

## How To Build Enterprise Architecture (EA)

- Document all critical IT systems and their relationships
- Map business processes to their supporting technology components
- Create visual representations of system dependencies
- Keep architecture documentation updated as systems change
- Share EA information with incident response teams

## Best Practices

- Maintain a single source of truth for architecture documentation
- Include service level objectives and recovery time objectives in your EA
- Use EA insights to develop more effective incident response playbooks
