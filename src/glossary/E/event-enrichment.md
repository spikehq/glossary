## What Is Event Enrichment

Event enrichment is the process of adding context and relevant information to raw event data. It helps incident responders quickly understand and prioritize events.

## Why Is Event Enrichment Important

Enriched events provide more actionable information, reducing the time to diagnose and resolve incidents. It helps teams focus on critical issues and make informed decisions faster.

## Example Of Event Enrichment

A server error event is enriched with information about the affected service, recent code deployments, and current user impact. This additional context helps the on-call engineer quickly assess the situation.

## How to Implement Event Enrichment

- Identify key data sources for enrichment (e.g., CMDB, monitoring tools)
- Set up integrations to pull relevant data in real-time
- Define rules for automatically adding context to events
- Implement a system to correlate related events
- Continuously refine your enrichment process based on feedback

## Best Practices

- Focus on adding truly valuable information to avoid noise
- Use standardized formats for enriched data to aid in analysis
- Ensure that enrichment doesn't significantly delay event processing
