## What Is Enterprise Architect

An Enterprise Architect is a strategic role responsible for designing and overseeing an organization's IT architecture to align with business goals. In incident management, they provide critical insights into system dependencies, potential impacts, and architectural solutions to prevent recurring incidents.

## Why Is Enterprise Architect Important

Enterprise Architects bring a holistic view of the organization's technology landscape during incident response and prevention. They help identify root causes that span multiple systems, design more resilient architectures, and ensure that incident-driven changes align with long-term technology strategy rather than creating technical debt.
