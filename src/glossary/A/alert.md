## What Is Alert

An Alert is a notification triggered when a monitored system, application, or service exceeds predefined thresholds or exhibits abnormal behavior. It serves as the initial signal that something requires attention in an incident management workflow.

## Why Is Alert Important

Alerts provide early warning of potential issues before they impact users. They enable proactive problem resolution and minimize downtime. Well-designed alerts help teams prioritize their response efforts based on severity and business impact.

## Example Of Alert

A database server's memory utilization crosses the 90% threshold for five consecutive minutes. The monitoring system generates an alert with severity "High" and automatically notifies the database team via Slack and email. The alert includes the server name, current memory usage, and a link to the performance dashboard.
