## What Is Autonomous Remediation

Autonomous Remediation is the automated execution of corrective actions to resolve incidents or problems in IT systems without human intervention. It uses predefined scripts and intelligent algorithms to implement fixes based on detected issues and their known solutions.

## Why Is Autonomous Remediation Important

Autonomous Remediation significantly reduces mean time to resolution (MTTR) by eliminating manual steps in the fix process. It provides consistent application of proven solutions, works around the clock, and scales to handle multiple simultaneous incidents across complex environments.

## Example Of Autonomous Remediation

When a database connection pool becomes exhausted, an autonomous remediation system automatically recycles the connection pool, adjusts the maximum connections parameter, and logs the action for later review by the database team.

## How To Implement Autonomous Remediation

- Document common remediation procedures for recurring incidents
- Convert manual remediation steps into automated scripts
- Test remediation scripts thoroughly in non-production environments
- Implement safeguards to prevent cascading failures
- Start with low-risk systems before expanding to critical infrastructure
