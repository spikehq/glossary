## What Is Automated Incident Creation

Automated Incident Creation is a process that automatically generates incident tickets or records when monitoring systems detect an issue or anomaly. It eliminates the need for manual ticket creation, allowing teams to focus on resolution rather than administrative tasks.

## Why Is Automated Incident Creation Important

Automated Incident Creation reduces response time by instantly documenting issues as they occur. It creates a consistent record of all incidents, eliminates human error in logging details, and helps teams track problems from detection to resolution without delay.

## Example of Automated Incident Creation

When a server's CPU usage exceeds 90% for more than five minutes, the monitoring system automatically creates an incident in the incident management platform. This incident includes server details, timestamp, and severity level based on predefined rules.
