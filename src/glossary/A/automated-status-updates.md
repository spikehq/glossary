## What Are Automated Status Updates

Automated Status Updates are system-generated communications that inform stakeholders about incident progress without manual intervention. These updates occur when predefined conditions are met or at scheduled intervals during an incident's lifecycle.

## Why Are Automated Status Updates Important

Automated Status Updates keep all stakeholders informed without distracting responders from resolution work. They provide consistent communication, reduce the need for status meetings during incidents, and create a reliable timeline of events for post-incident review.

## Example Of Automated Status Updates

When an incident moves from "investigating" to "identified" status, the system automatically updates the status page and sends notifications to affected teams. It also posts hourly updates to the incident channel until resolution.
