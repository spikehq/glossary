## What Is Alert Prioritization

Alert prioritization is the process of assigning importance levels to incoming alerts based on business impact, urgency, and severity. It helps incident teams identify which issues require immediate attention versus those that can be addressed later.

## Why Is Alert Prioritization Important

Alert prioritization ensures critical incidents receive prompt attention while less urgent issues wait. It optimizes resource allocation, reduces mean time to resolution for high-impact problems, and helps teams maintain service level agreements.

## Example Of Alert Prioritization

An e-commerce platform automatically assigns highest priority to payment processing alerts, medium priority to search functionality issues, and low priority to non-customer-facing administrative tools based on business impact.
