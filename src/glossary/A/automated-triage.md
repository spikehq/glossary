## What Is Automated Triage

Automated Triage is a process that uses predefined rules and algorithms to automatically assess, categorize, and prioritize incoming incidents without human intervention. It routes alerts to appropriate teams based on severity, type, and other factors to speed up initial response times.

## Why Is Automated Triage Important

Automated Triage reduces the manual effort needed to sort through incidents, allowing teams to focus on resolution rather than classification. It significantly decreases response times for critical issues and helps prevent alert fatigue by ensuring only relevant notifications reach responders.

## Example Of Automated Triage

When a database server sends a high CPU usage alert, an automated triage system immediately categorizes it as a performance issue, assigns it high priority based on the server's importance, and routes it to the database team's on-call engineer with relevant context attached.

## How To Implement Automated Triage With Spike

- Set up rules in Spike to auto-assign incidents by severity, source, or keywords.
- Use workflows to add tags, change priority, or update status the moment an alert arrives.
- Route incidents to the right team or on-call engineer based on your chosen criteria.
- Let Spike add key incident details so the responder gets full context without extra steps.
