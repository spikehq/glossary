## What Is Automated Notification

Automated Notification is a system that sends alerts to relevant stakeholders when incidents occur or change status. These notifications can be delivered through multiple channels like email, SMS, phone calls, or messaging platforms without manual intervention.

## Why Is Automated Notification Important

Automated Notification speeds up response times by immediately alerting the right people. It reduces the risk of incidents being overlooked, keeps stakeholders informed throughout the incident lifecycle, and allows teams to focus on resolution rather than communication tasks.

## Example of Automated Notification

When a critical payment system goes down, automated notifications are sent to the engineering team via Slack, to the on-call engineer via phone call, and to leadership via email. As the incident progresses, status updates are automatically sent to all parties.
