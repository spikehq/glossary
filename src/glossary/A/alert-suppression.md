## What Is Alert Suppression

Alert suppression is the temporary or conditional blocking of specific alerts to prevent notification fatigue during known issues, maintenance periods, or non-actionable events. It reduces noise while maintaining visibility for truly important incidents.

## Why Is Alert Suppression Important

Alert suppression prevents teams from receiving redundant notifications during known incidents. It reduces alert fatigue, helps responders focus on new or unknown issues, and prevents unnecessary escalations during planned maintenance activities.

## Example Of Alert Suppression

During a planned database migration, a DevOps team suppresses all database connectivity alerts for two hours. This prevents hundreds of expected alerts from triggering notifications while still monitoring other critical systems.
