## What Is Alert Routing

Alert routing is the process of directing incident notifications to the appropriate individuals or teams based on factors like incident type, severity, affected systems, and team expertise. It ensures the right people receive relevant alerts at the right time.

## Why Is Alert Routing Important

Proper alert routing minimizes response time by immediately notifying the most qualified responders. It prevents alert overload for any single team, distributes on-call burden fairly, and increases the likelihood of swift incident resolution by matching incidents with subject matter experts.

## Example Of Alert Routing

When a payment processing service experiences an outage, the alert routing system automatically notifies the payments team rather than the general infrastructure team. This brings specialized expertise to the problem immediately, reducing time to resolution.
