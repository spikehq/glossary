## What Is Automated Escalation

Automated escalation is a process that automatically routes alerts to additional or higher-level responders when certain conditions are met, such as time thresholds or severity levels. It ensures critical incidents receive attention even when initial responders are unavailable.

## Why Is Automated Escalation Important

Automated escalation prevents incidents from being overlooked or delayed. It creates accountability, reduces response times for critical issues, and provides a safety net for when primary responders are unavailable or overwhelmed.

## Example Of Automated Escalation

A critical production outage alert initially goes to the on-call engineer. After 15 minutes without acknowledgment, the system automatically escalates to the entire engineering team and the engineering manager.
