## What Is Attack Vector

An attack vector is a specific path or method that an attacker uses to gain unauthorized access to a system, network, or application during a security incident. Common attack vectors include phishing emails, vulnerable software, unsecured APIs, weak passwords, and social engineering techniques.

## Why Identifying Attack Vector Important

Identifying attack vectors helps incident response teams understand how breaches occur and develop targeted prevention strategies. It allows for faster incident resolution by pinpointing entry methods, guides remediation efforts, and improves future security measures.

## Example Of Attack Vector

A company experiences a data breach. During incident investigation, the team discovers the attack vector was a phishing email that tricked an employee into revealing their credentials, which attackers then used to access sensitive customer information.
