## What Is AI Triage

AI Triage is the use of artificial intelligence to automatically assess and categorize incoming incidents based on their description, affected systems, and potential impact. It determines the priority, required expertise, and initial response steps without human intervention.

## Why Is AI Triage Important

AI Triage reduces the time between incident detection and the start of resolution. It eliminates bottlenecks in the triage process, maintains consistent prioritization regardless of who's on call, and frees up human responders to focus on solving rather than sorting problems.

## Example of AI Triage

When a customer reports that the checkout process is failing, the AI triage system analyzes the report, checks related system metrics, and determines it's a high-priority payment processing issue. It automatically routes the incident to the payments team and suggests immediate investigation steps.

## How to Implement AI Triage

- Train AI models using historical incident data with known classifications
- Define clear severity levels and routing rules for the AI to follow
- Integrate with communication channels where incidents are reported
- Implement confidence thresholds for when to involve human judgment
- Create feedback mechanisms to improve AI decisions over time
