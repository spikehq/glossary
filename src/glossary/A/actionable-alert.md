## What Is Actionable Alert

An actionable alert is a notification that provides clear, specific information about an incident that requires immediate attention and includes enough context for responders to take appropriate action. Unlike general alerts, actionable alerts contain details about the problem, its potential impact, and suggested remediation steps.

## Why Is Actionable Alert Important

Actionable alerts reduce response time by eliminating the guesswork for on-call teams. They help prevent alert fatigue by ensuring that notifications are meaningful and necessary. When alerts provide clear context and actionable information, teams can resolve incidents faster and with less stress.

## Example Of Actionable Alert

Instead of a vague alert like "Database Error," an actionable alert would read: "Order processing database CPU usage at 95% - affecting checkout process - check recent query performance and consider scaling resources."
