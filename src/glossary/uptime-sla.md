## What Is Uptime SLA

An Uptime SLA (Service Level Agreement) is a contractual commitment that defines the minimum acceptable level of system availability. It specifies the percentage of time a service must be operational, outlines consequences for failing to meet these standards, and establishes measurement methods.

## Why Is Uptime SLA Important

Uptime SLAs create clear expectations between service providers and customers. They provide a framework for accountability, help prioritize incident response, and offer financial incentives for maintaining reliable services. Well-crafted SLAs protect both providers and customers during service disruptions.

## Example Of Uptime SLA

A cloud hosting provider offers an SLA guaranteeing 99.95% monthly uptime. If availability drops below this threshold, customers receive service credits proportional to the downtime. During a major outage, availability dropped to 99.8%, triggering automatic credits to affected customers.

## Types Of Uptime SLAs

- Basic SLAs: Simple uptime guarantees with limited compensation
- Tiered SLAs: Different uptime guarantees based on service level purchased
- Custom SLAs: Tailored agreements for enterprise customers with specific needs
- Weighted SLAs: Different uptime requirements for different components or time periods
