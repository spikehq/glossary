## What Is Severity Automation

Severity Automation is the process of using predefined rules and algorithms to automatically assign severity levels to incidents based on their characteristics. It evaluates factors like service impact, number of affected users, and business criticality to determine how urgent an incident is without manual intervention.

## Why Is Severity Automation Important

Severity Automation speeds up incident triage and ensures consistent severity classification. It removes subjective human judgment that might lead to inconsistent prioritization. This automation helps teams focus on the most critical issues first and allocate resources appropriately.

## Example Of Severity Automation

An e-commerce platform experiences a partial outage. The severity automation system detects that the issue affects the checkout process during a major sales event. It automatically assigns a "Critical" severity level and triggers immediate notifications to the senior response team.
