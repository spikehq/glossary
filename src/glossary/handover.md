## What Is Handover

Handover is the formal process of transferring responsibility for an ongoing incident from one person or team to another. This typically occurs during shift changes, when specialized expertise is needed, or when an incident extends beyond a single work period.

## Why Is Handover Important

Effective handovers maintain continuity in incident response, prevent information loss, and reduce resolution time. They ensure that incoming responders have the context and information needed to continue addressing the incident without delays or duplicated efforts.

## Example Of Handover

A network engineer troubleshoots a connectivity issue for six hours but hasn't resolved it before their shift ends. They conduct a handover to the incoming engineer, sharing their findings, attempted solutions, and current theories about the root cause.

- You can add notes directly to the incident timeline to share context with the next responder
- Use escalations to automatically pass incidents to the right person if they aren't handled quickly
- The incident timeline clearly shows who did what and when, giving full context
- Team members can easily see who is currently on-call and responsible for an incident
