## What Are Integrated Status Pages

Integrated Status Pages are centralized dashboards that display real-time information about the operational status of various services, applications, and infrastructure components. They connect directly with monitoring tools and incident management systems to provide automated, up-to-date visibility into system health.

## Why Are Integrated Status Pages Important

Integrated Status Pages reduce confusion during incidents by providing a single source of truth for all stakeholders. They improve communication efficiency, eliminate the need for manual updates, and help build trust with users through transparency about service disruptions and resolutions.

## Example Of Integrated Status Pages

A cloud service provider uses an integrated status page that automatically reflects the current state of their database, storage, and compute services. When a database incident occurs, the status page immediately shows "Degraded Performance" for the affected service, along with incident details and estimated resolution time.
