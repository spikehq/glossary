## What Is Threat

In incident management, a threat is any potential danger that could exploit vulnerabilities in a system, leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, service disruptions, or other harmful outcomes. Threats can be intentional (like cyberattacks) or unintentional (like human error or natural disasters).

## Why Understanding Threat Important

Understanding threats is crucial for proactive incident management. By identifying potential threats before they materialize, organizations can implement preventive measures, develop appropriate response plans, and allocate resources effectively. This awareness helps minimize the impact of incidents and reduces recovery time.

## Example Of Threat

A newly discovered software vulnerability in a widely-used application could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data. This represents a threat that must be addressed through patching, configuration changes, or other mitigation strategies before it can be exploited.
