## What Is Fix

A fix is a solution or correction implemented to resolve an incident or problem. In incident management, fixes can range from simple restarts to complex code changes or infrastructure modifications that address the root cause of an issue.

## Why Is Fix Important

Fixes restore normal service operations and prevent incident recurrence. They transform reactive incident response into proactive problem management. Properly documented fixes also build organizational knowledge and improve future incident handling.

## Example Of Fix

After investigating a website outage, engineers discover a memory leak in a new code release. They implement a fix by patching the code to properly release memory resources and deploy it through an emergency change process.
