## What Is On-Call Load

On-call load is the number of incidents, alerts, or pages an on-call engineer receives during their shift. It measures the workload and stress placed on the person covering incidents.

## Why Is Tracking On-Call Load Important

Tracking on-call load helps teams spot burnout risks and balance workloads. It also helps improve incident response by distributing alerts more evenly.

## How To Measure And Manage On-Call Load

- Track the number of alerts and incidents per on-call shift
- Use reporting tools to analyze patterns over time
- Adjust shift schedules or team size based on data
- Set alert thresholds to reduce noise and false alarms
