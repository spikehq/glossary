## What Is Root Cause Analysis (RCA)

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a systematic process for identifying the fundamental cause of an incident or problem. It involves investigating beyond immediate symptoms to discover the underlying issues that, when corrected, prevent similar incidents from recurring.

## Why Is Root Cause Analysis Important

RCA prevents future incidents by addressing underlying issues rather than symptoms. It transforms incidents into learning opportunities, improves system reliability, and reduces downtime. Effective RCA leads to meaningful improvements in processes, technology, and training.

## Example Of Root Cause Analysis

After a payment system outage, an RCA reveals that the incident started with a network configuration change. Further analysis shows the root causes were inadequate change management processes and missing automated tests for network changes.
