## What Is Internal Status Page

An Internal Status Page is a private dashboard that shows the operational status of an organization's internal systems, tools, and services. It provides employees with real-time updates about incidents, planned maintenance, and system health without exposing sensitive information to external users.

## Why Is Internal Status Page Important

Internal Status Pages reduce support ticket volume by keeping employees informed about known issues. They improve productivity by providing clear expectations about system availability and estimated resolution times. They also create transparency across departments about IT operations and priorities.

## Example Of Internal Status Page

A company's internal status page shows that the HR portal is experiencing slowness, the VPN service is down for maintenance, and all other internal tools are functioning normally. IT teams can update the page with progress notes as they work on resolving the issues.
