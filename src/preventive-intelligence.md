## What Is Preventive Intelligence

Preventive intelligence is the systematic collection and analysis of data to identify potential incidents before they occur. It combines threat intelligence, performance metrics, change data, and external factors to predict and prevent service disruptions.

## Why Is Preventive Intelligence Important

Preventive intelligence helps organizations stay ahead of potential incidents rather than constantly reacting to them. It reduces downtime, preserves customer trust, and allows teams to address underlying issues methodically rather than during crisis situations.

## Example Of Preventive Intelligence

A cloud provider's intelligence system correlates upcoming weather forecasts with data center locations and historical performance. It predicts potential power issues during an approaching storm and automatically initiates workload migration to unaffected regions.

## How To Implement Preventive Intelligence

- Establish data collection from internal and external sources
- Develop correlation rules to identify potential risk patterns
- Create actionable intelligence reports for different stakeholders
- Build automated alerting for high-confidence predictions
- Continuously refine intelligence based on outcomes

## Best Practices

- Combine technical metrics with business context for meaningful intelligence
- Establish clear thresholds for when to act on intelligence
- Create feedback loops to improve intelligence quality over time
