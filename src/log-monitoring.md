## What Is Log Monitoring

Log monitoring is the continuous observation of log files to detect issues in real-time. It involves automated scanning of logs for predefined patterns, anomalies, or threshold breaches that might indicate an incident is occurring or about to occur.

## Why Is Log Monitoring Important

Log monitoring provides early warning of potential incidents, allowing teams to address issues before they impact users. It transforms passive log data into active alerts that trigger incident response, reducing downtime and service disruptions.

## Example Of Log Monitoring

A monitoring system detects an unusual spike in authentication failures in the login service logs. It automatically alerts the on-call engineer, who investigates and discovers a brute force attack attempt, allowing them to block the malicious IP addresses before any accounts are compromised.

## How To Do Log Monitoring

- Define critical events and error conditions to monitor
- Set up automated alerts for these conditions
- Establish thresholds for normal vs. abnormal activity
- Configure real-time dashboards for visual monitoring
- Integrate with your incident management system

## Best Practices

- Focus on actionable alerts to avoid alert fatigue
- Use correlation rules to group related log events
- Regularly review and refine monitoring rules based on past incidents
