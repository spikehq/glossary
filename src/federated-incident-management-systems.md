## What Are Federated Incident Management Systems

Federated Incident Management Systems connect multiple incident management platforms across different teams, departments, or organizations to create a unified view of incidents while maintaining local control. They allow separate teams to use their preferred tools while sharing critical incident data.

## Why Are Federated Incident Management Systems Important

Federated systems support collaboration between teams with different tools and processes. They break down silos in large organizations, enable cross-team incident response, and provide comprehensive visibility without forcing standardization on a single platform or workflow.

## Example Of Federated Incident Management Systems

A global company has development teams in the US using PagerDuty, European teams using Opsgenie, and cloud operations using Spike. Their federated system connects these platforms so incidents affecting multiple regions appear in each team's preferred tool, with updates synchronized across all systems.

## How To Implement Federated Incident Management Systems

- Identify all incident management tools currently in use across teams
- Implement API integrations between different platforms
- Create data mapping to standardize incident information across systems
- Establish rules for incident ownership and handoffs between teams
- Test cross-platform workflows with simulated incidents

## Best Practices

- Maintain a central incident registry even with distributed management tools
- Standardize severity definitions and escalation criteria across all systems
- Create clear documentation for cross-team incident handling procedures
