## What Is Waterfall Method

The Waterfall method is a traditional project management approach characterized by a linear, sequential flow. Each project phase (like requirements, design, implementation, testing) must be fully completed before the next phase begins. It emphasizes upfront planning and documentation.

## Why Is Waterfall Method Important

In the context surrounding incident management, Waterfall is rarely used for direct incident response due to its inflexibility. However, it might be suitable for specific, well-defined projects resulting from an incident. This could include implementing a new system or control where requirements are fixed and unlikely to change.

## Example Of Waterfall Method

Following a compliance finding during an incident review, a project is launched to build a new, physically separate logging server. Requirements are fixed by regulation. The project follows Waterfall phases: define hardware specs, design network placement, build and configure the server, test log ingestion, deploy.

## How To Implement Waterfall Method

- Clearly define all project requirements upfront
- Break the project into distinct, sequential phases
- Develop a detailed project plan with timelines for each phase
- Complete and get sign-off for each phase before starting the next
- Manage changes strictly through a formal change control process

## Best Practices

- Use Waterfall only when requirements are stable and well-understood
- Invest heavily in detailed upfront planning and documentation
- Implement strong scope control to prevent changes mid-project

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Using Waterfall for projects where requirements might evolve (common after incidents)
- Discovering design flaws late in the process, requiring costly rework
- Lack of flexibility to adapt to new information learned during the project
