## What Is Automated Triage Workflow

Automated Triage Workflow is a systematic process that uses predefined rules and algorithms to automatically categorize, prioritize, and route incidents to the appropriate teams or individuals without manual intervention. It streamlines the initial assessment of incidents based on their severity, impact, and other relevant factors.

## Why Is Automated Triage Workflow Important

Automated Triage Workflow reduces response times by eliminating manual sorting of incidents. It helps teams focus on resolution rather than administrative tasks, creates consistency in incident handling, and scales effectively during major outages when multiple incidents occur simultaneously.

## Example Of Automated Triage Workflow

When a server monitoring tool detects high CPU usage, the automated triage workflow classifies it as a performance incident, assigns it medium priority, and routes it to the infrastructure team. The workflow also attaches relevant server metrics and recent change logs to provide context.

## How To Implement Automated Triage Workflow With Spike

- Set up custom rules in Spike to auto-categorize incidents by severity, source, or keywords.
- Use routing policies to send each incident type to the right team or on-call member.
- Add automatic assignments and set priorities based on incident details in the payload.
- Attach relevant context, like logs or runbooks, using Spike’s incident templates.
- Track every step of your triage process through Spike’s incident timeline.
