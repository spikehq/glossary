## What Is Downtime

Downtime refers to the period when a system, service, or infrastructure is unavailable or not functioning as intended. In incident management, downtime represents the time between when an outage begins and when normal service is restored, directly impacting business operations and user experience.

## Why Is Tracking Downtime Important

Downtime is critical to track because it directly affects business continuity, customer satisfaction, and revenue. Understanding downtime patterns helps organizations prioritize system improvements, allocate resources effectively, and develop realistic recovery strategies to minimize future service disruptions.

## Example Of Downtime

A cloud service provider experiences a network failure at 2:00 PM, making their customer portal inaccessible. The technical team resolves the issue by 3:30 PM. The total downtime is 90 minutes, during which customers cannot access their accounts or data.

## How To Track Downtime

- Set up automated monitoring tools to detect and timestamp outages
- Create a standardized process for logging downtime incidents
- Establish clear criteria for what constitutes the start and end of downtime
- Categorize downtime by cause, affected systems, and impact level
- Calculate and report downtime metrics regularly to stakeholders

## Best Practices

- Schedule planned downtime during off-peak hours to minimize user impact
- Communicate proactively with users about both planned and unplanned downtime
- Conduct thorough post-incident reviews to prevent similar causes of downtime in the future
