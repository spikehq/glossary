## What Is Initial Response

Initial response is the first set of actions taken after an incident is detected. It includes assessing the situation, containing the impact, and starting communication with key stakeholders.

## Why Is Initial Response Important

A strong initial response can limit damage, speed up recovery, and keep everyone aligned. It sets the foundation for effective incident management.

## Example Of Initial Response

After a security breach alert, the IT team isolates affected systems, notifies leadership, and gathers information for further investigation.

## How To Implement Initial Response

- Create clear response playbooks for common incidents
- Train teams on immediate containment steps
- Use automated alerts for faster action
- Assign communication roles early
- Review and update response steps after each incident
