## What Is Joint Incident View

A Joint Incident View is a shared, real-time display of information about an ongoing incident. It provides a common operational picture for everyone involved. This includes status, impacted services, responders, actions taken, and communications.

## Why Is Joint Incident View Important

It improves situational awareness across teams and stakeholders. A shared view reduces confusion and duplicative communication efforts. This allows responders to focus more on resolution and less on providing status updates.

## Example Of Joint Incident View

During a website outage, engineers, support agents, and managers access a central dashboard. It shows which systems are down, who is working on the fix, key findings, and the latest customer communication updates. This keeps everyone aligned without constant meetings.

## How To Create Joint Incident View

- Use an incident management platform with shared dashboard capabilities
- Integrate data feeds from monitoring, alerting, and communication tools
- Assign roles responsible for keeping the view updated (e.g., scribe, incident commander)
- Ensure appropriate access levels for different stakeholders

## Best Practices

- Update the view frequently with accurate, concise information
- Tailor information presented based on the audience (e.g., technical vs. executive view)
- Clearly indicate the timestamp of the last update

## Common Pitfalls To Avoid

- Displaying overwhelming amounts of irrelevant data
- Information becoming outdated, leading to mistrust in the view
- Technical difficulties preventing access to the view during an incident
