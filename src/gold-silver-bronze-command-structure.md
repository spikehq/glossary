## What Is Gold-Silver-Bronze Command Structure

The Gold-Silver-Bronze Command Structure is a hierarchical incident management framework used to organize response teams during major incidents. Gold level handles strategic decisions, Silver manages tactical coordination, and Bronze executes operational tasks on the ground. This three-tier approach creates clear lines of authority and communication during complex incidents.

## Why Is Gold-Silver-Bronze Command Structure Important

This command structure prevents chaos during major incidents by establishing clear roles and decision-making authority. It separates strategic planning from tactical execution, allowing each level to focus on appropriate tasks. The structure also scales well for incidents of varying complexity and provides a common framework that works across different teams and organizations.

## Example Of Gold-Silver-Bronze Command Structure

During a major service outage, the Gold commander (CTO) sets priorities and communicates with executives. The Silver commander (IT Director) coordinates resources across teams. Bronze commanders (team leads) direct engineers to implement specific fixes. This hierarchy prevents conflicting actions and maintains order throughout the incident response.

## How To Create Gold-Silver-Bronze Command Structure

- Define clear roles and responsibilities for each command level
- Create escalation paths between Bronze, Silver, and Gold levels
- Establish communication protocols between command levels
- Train team members on their specific roles within the structure
- Practice with simulated incidents before real emergencies occur

## Best Practices

- Document the command structure in your incident response playbooks
- Rotate staff through different command roles during drills to build versatility
- Keep communication channels open between levels while respecting the chain of command
