## What Is Business Impact Dashboard

A Business Impact Dashboard is a visual display that shows how incidents affect business metrics and customer experience in real-time. It translates technical incidents into business terms by displaying metrics like revenue impact, affected customers, transaction failures, and service availability.

## Why Is Business Impact Dashboard Important

Business Impact Dashboards bridge the gap between technical and business teams during incidents. They help leadership understand the real-world consequences of outages without technical jargon. These dashboards enable more informed decisions about resource allocation and communication strategies during critical incidents.

## Example Of Business Impact Dashboard

During a checkout system slowdown, the dashboard shows 230 affected customers, $15,000 in delayed transactions, and a 12% drop in conversion rate. This helps the business team prepare customer communications while technical teams work on the fix.

## How To Create Business Impact Dashboard

- Identify key business metrics that incidents typically affect
- Connect monitoring systems to business data sources
- Create visualizations that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- Set thresholds for different impact severity levels
- Configure dashboard access for various stakeholder groups

## Best Practices

- Include trend data to show if the situation is improving or worsening
- Use color coding and visual indicators for quick status assessment
- Customize views for different audiences (executives, support, technical teams)
