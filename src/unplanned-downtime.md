## What Is Unplanned Downtime

Unplanned downtime is an unexpected period when a system, service, or infrastructure becomes unavailable, disrupting normal operations. It occurs without warning due to hardware failures, software bugs, network issues, power outages, or human error, causing immediate impact to business operations.

## Example Of Unplanned Downtime

A database server crashes during peak business hours due to a hardware failure. The incident management team receives alerts, diagnoses the issue, and works to restore service while communicating updates to stakeholders. The entire process takes three hours, affecting customer transactions.

## Types Of Unplanned Downtime

- Infrastructure failures: Hardware malfunctions, network outages, or power disruptions
- Software issues: Bugs, memory leaks, or compatibility problems
- Security incidents: DDoS attacks, ransomware, or other cyber threats
- Human error: Accidental configuration changes or improper maintenance
