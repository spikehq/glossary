## What Is On-Call Shift

An on-call shift is a set period when a team member is responsible for responding to incidents. Shifts can last hours or days, depending on the schedule.

## Why Is On-Call Shift Important

On-call shifts make sure someone is always ready to respond to incidents, even outside normal business hours.

## How To Implement On-Call Shift

- Define shift length and coverage needed for your team
- Use an on-call scheduling tool to assign shifts
- Provide clear escalation paths and support resources

## Best Practices

- Rotate on-call shifts fairly among team members
- Offer time off or compensation after heavy on-call periods
